I learnt to use rudder on trad heli’s so this new mode is certainly different, more like driving a RC car. Feels unnatural for a 'copter but I’m sure one could get used to it quickly. Don’t try roll to avoid an obstacle like I did… missed it but a tiny moment of panic there "

2,Welcome v3.1 and thanks dev team,7,"Finally it’s here! Huge thank you all those involved for making this release possible. ArduCopter has come so far in the last two years, it’s more amazing than most realize! Details of the release here: *","Thanks guys for the update. I put it onto the PIXHAWK rev. 2.3 and it worked nice after Compass and ACC cali. I did not try to do compassmot, since the XYZ values were below 150 and I did not notice misbehavior regarding this at 3.1RC4. AltHold worked fine as well, surprisingly, since Randy reported some errors with the “old” PIXHAWK. A little bit confusing, that the PIXHAWK changed its startup sound…bye bye… nice bird whistle at the start. But I have a Question: What exactly does Load IRIS Defaults do ?  I (idiot) did not save the Parameter set of RC4, since I figured that they are loaded by this button anyways…but since only a RC config page (flight modes?) showed up, after using this button , Im not sure anymore… Btw. I noticed  (after trying several MP revs, USB HUB, different cables , stripping all add ons) that the update of the PIXHAWK hasnt been possible with my Thinkpad T43 , LenovoT60 and X60s, which worked together well with the APM before and did well with the PIXHAW config . It did not make any difference using an active HUB or unplugging all the externals. An older HP notebook did the job right away…"

Drift seems great other than the fact I have the turning on the finger with the throttle taking away the advantage. A simple drop down to select if drift is on rudder or aileron would be great (seems kinda unnatural not to put turning on the rudder to me but then again most people are mode 1 or 2 internationally I guess…)"

Would there be a way to use the programming for drift as the turning command at waypoints to eliminate the hard yaw/mechanical turn behavior it uses now?

Thanks!, i´m using an hexacopter RCtimer 550 motors HP2212-1000KV , speeds: SK30A, 1045 Carbon Fiber Prop, 4500ma 4S Lipo, external BEC, APM 2.5, external GPS, Futaba 8g, RX Corona 8Ch 2.4 , 5%compassmot. I used to fly with 3.01 and it flies really well. It did great RTL´s and a couple misions OK, with land included. A week ago i actualized to 3.1. Just a few flies, but i notices that loiter its similar to preview version (really good), but when i rotate the hexa - give some yaw - it´s lost the Z axis, i mean it moves outwards. With 3.01 version i did a lot of turns in loiter mode and it always kept the Z axis, but now it moves…more yaw i give more displacement… i try increasing Ploiter…and i tried many times…it´s go better increasing P and I Loiter…and with more altitude. I tried a couple of RTLS fine and a mision and went ok…but i dont know what´s hapend in loiter mode with yaw… any idea? Many thanks!"

9,Sharp increase in negative vertical speed in Loiter and RTL modes,0,"Hello. Please help me figure out the problem. The copter (frame F330, APM2.8 on vibration isolation, firmware 3.2.1, powered by a current sensor - power module) flew on PIDs by default, it was staggering, but tolerable. Carried out auto-tuning. The swaying has ceased, but now it often tries to spontaneously increase its vertical speed while descending, up to a collision with the ground. This is not a fall, but a stabilized landing at high speed (I’ve seen up to 4.5 m / s on FPV). We fly mainly in Loiter and RTL modes. In these modes, the described phenomenon occurs. Before autotuning, we flew a lot and there were no such problems. Previously, the GPS module was replaced (Ublox M7N). The old battery ran out and after replacing it, it has become unstable to determine the position. Once I could not give 3D FIX for 30 minutes. Was replaced by a new one (Ublox M8N. As it turned out later - counterfeit with the impossibility of flashing). We flew with the new one without any problems. Autotuning has been performed with a new module. We tried to roll back PIDs to old ones, reload firmware, load default parameters. No result. I tried to analyze the logs. Started with DAlt and Alt. When dropped, they match. Ie he “wants” to fall? Then ThrIn (aka RC3) and ThrOut. At the moment of the fall, ThrOut is at its maximum. And ThrIn becomes maximum with a delay (until we figure out that we need to pull the stick). ThrOut and AngBst. At the moment of falling AngBst increases and becomes equal to ThrOut or even exceeds it, but with a “-” sign. It looks like this setting is cumulative with ThrOut. If this is the case, then nothing should come out of the regulators at all, which seems to be true. And the most mysterious pair is Alt and GPS / Vz. It is not clear to me how, when climbing, Vz can be negative and when descending, it can be positive? I thought this was the case. I changed the GPS module back to the old one. This time he gave 3D FIX. But nothing has changed. In which direction to look is not clear. An internet search yielded nothing",

In any case the Pixhawk uses communication, it isn’t like we’re calibrating PWM inputs here, keep legacy analogue behaviour out of the digital world !!. 2 : The DJI ESC’s that I have CAN NOT be calibrated, that’s why the 0 to 1000 business on the outputs needs to be managed and verified to get the best / appropriate performance out of the motors although not sure how this bit works. I have seen a number of posts indicating that the output scaling used by the Pixhawk is totally inappropriate on DJI ESC’s. 3 : The Taranis transmitter I have allows me to set whatever minimum and maximum value I see fit to each and every channel so it isn’t too hard to know exactly what my transmitter will be sending - given that it too is open source and I have the code for that too. It should be possible to test / calibrate and verify control outputs at ANY stage using simulated input regardless of whether the real input is present or not. The motor test should not depend on RC calibrations. If I tell a motor to go to 50% then I want to see it at 50% with no software interference beyond appropriate scaling to map input range onto output range. If the motor at 50% stick then doesn’t match the 50% output expected then there is an issue to resolve, this is also why it needs to be possible to bypass PID’s etc to stop them winding motors up in some vain attempt to level a copter that hasn’t even left the ground - it’s called ground test mode as opposed to flight test mode. I can test the motor using an ESC tester but that doesn’t test the ‘system’. As for the ‘we removed it for safety reasons’ that is a slippery slope to dulled down crappy software, no matter what you do there will always be a better idiot who will do something really really stupid. At some point you must credit the ‘user’ with having some brains. Providing the ‘facilities’ provided by terminal exist in the APM Planner then good riddance, but if the facilities don’t exist then the terminal should stay, Sorry if this comes over harsh but I do this kind of thing for a living - partly why I’ve ‘come to play’ with APM / Pixhawk  etc etc."

In a car you have to constantly vary throttle to maintain speed which cruise control does quite nicely, but on the a quad you only have to set the throttle to half way and then leave it. I’m fairly sure though if you just set up your auto centering transmitter the same as you would a standard one it should work. As you have to bring throttle to 0% to arm, just let it rise back to 50% very slowly and see how the quad reacts. If it doesn’t react how you expect drop the throttle back and disarm it."

31,Need help on connection between Arduino and APM 2.8 for simple Sonar Obstacle avoidance,0,"Hello there, Currently I am doing a project using APM 2.8 and i wish to add a simple obstacle avoidance system to it using cheap sonar like HC-SR04, i just need the copter to back off when the sonar detects and object in front. Directly connecting the sonar onto the APM would not be a choice as there is no more space in the memory to accommodate new commands. The only way to do it is to use an external processor/controller like Arduino or raspberry pi. currently i have an Arduino Mega 2560. What I understand from many hours of reading forums, is that there are a few ways to do it. Either using I2C connection, UART or sending pwm signal to the input on APM like how the RC sends the signal to the APM. But i couldn’t find a guide on how to set up the connection and how to even send and read messages through MAVLink. Please can anyone guide me on this? Many thanks in advance.  Regards, Jack Kee",

Best regards,","Hi, First, I would recommend using the last stable software version for the APM 2.6 which was Copter 3.2.1.  As far as your question on how to create a new airframe, this is not a simple request, especially in this version of software.  Even if you were well versed with C++, this will take some time.  I created a compound heli frame in version 3.3 and that took me the better part of a week in the evenings to get that working.  Granted I’m not a seasoned C++ programmer.  So I have two options to offer up:  Use the commits of another user that did something similar.  I had followed fhedberg’s modifications to the code to produce the compound frame and adjusted them slightly for my application.  you can look at his repo or my compound heli repo for AC 3.3.3 here  Or buy a pixhawk or other flight controller capable of hosting AC 3.5.5.  Making new frames in this version is much easier.  I converted my compound frame from AC 3.3.3 to AC 3.5.5 in one night.  Regards, Bill"

How are you controlling the vertical axis (i.e. Climb and descent) The trad heli code can be set up so it does an old style swashplate where pitch and roll are independent servos.

Best regards,",Very interesting set up.  we can make this work for the using the TradHeli software but it won’t be ideal for the vertical axis.  The tradheli code is set up for a constant speed variable pitch main rotor control in the vertical axis.  So I would recommend using mode 3 which I’m not sure how well that works in AC 3.2.1.  I think it is just a V-curve but you could set it up so it outputs a proportional output to your collective stick.  I would not recommend just hooking up the ESC to the collective output.  Then you lose the safety protections for the esc’s.  I’m not even sure how well the  Direct Drive Fixed Pitch (DDFP) system works for the tailrotors in this version of the code.  This is slightly before my time of working on the code. Be careful when setting this up and make sure you remove the props.

The first specific problem we have is that we can’t get the quad to yaw to point the camera where it’s directed to by the DO_SET_ROI commands. Tilt works sometimes (I think depending on which GCS we’re using and what we have done as far as SET_MOUNT commands and the WP_YAW_BEHAVIOUR parameter). We’re working around this with a CONDITION_YAW but it’s hardly ideal since we need so many waypoints (even in a straight line) to keep the target in frame. This remains true for both the right-click ‘point camera here’ command and when sandwiching do_set_roi’s in-between mission items. Tried in both GUIDED and AUTO modes. In the gimbal setup tab in mission planner we only have tilt enabled on CH9 and controlled by RC CH6 input, and none of the stabilise options are selected. We’re flying a 3DR IRIS with 3.1.3 firmware and with the Tarot 2d Gimbal All is connected and set up as per the manuals, with the appropriate parameters file that you posted about recently. So I guess to be more specific with my previous post:  What do we need to do to tell the system that it needs to yaw the quad in order to do ROI’s? What parameters affect the ROI and yaw behaviour or the system in Copter 3.1 ? WP_YAW_BEHAVIOUR, SET_MOUNT, others?  I assume we’re just missing something obvious, but I also know we’re not the only ones… Cheers."

If you wanted to use SBUS, better throw away your APM and changed to Pixhawk. APM only accept PWM & PPM signal. Lucky you, R12DSM can be used on PPM too. You only need to double push binding button on R12DSM till led changed to red which indicated worked on PPM. Now you connect R12DSM pins (Signal, Vcc, Ground) to pin input channel 1 on APM board. But before that, you must activated PPM mode input on APM by jumped in signal pin 2 and 3 on APM board. I don’t have experience on KK2 but from what I know, KK2 can use PPM and SBUS.

42,HW:Apm 252 SW:3.1.5 flash chip replacement,0,Hi! to all members. I have a question related mostly to 3.1.5 coding. I have an APM 252_V5 for my Quanum Nova  and have a failes flash chip ATMEL AT45DB161 (16Mbit) type. I have to replace it with an AT45DB321 (32Mbit) type. My question is as the two chips are completely intendical the only difference in code handling is the chip ID byte. Does arducopter 3.1.5 uses this type of data to intentify chip or no so I can replace with the 32Mbit flash (instead of 16Mbit) and make ot to log data again? Thank you for your time my friends! Alex,

Can someone tell me exactly what parameter I can set (for stabilize and alt-hold mode) that will prevent it from descending too quickly even if I’m a little overzealous on cutting-back the throttle? Thank you in advance, Brian","you will find descend parameters (two) here: * these will not limit stabilize mode, if you need to limit that, the only option is MOT_SPIN_ARMED Anyway, to feel the turbulent air during vertical descend is normal  - but if it’s like you describe it below a sink rate of ~1.5m/s , (you almost flip), then you should check for motor/esc sync problems, or you will crash."

Thank you in advance, Brian","It definitely isn’t a motor sync issue (I know that for a number of reasons). The vehicle has impressive performance characteristics.  It’s basically some T-Motor U3’s, a battery and a little bit of carbon fiber holding the entire thing together. Here’s what I’ve noticed though:  If I take the throttle to zero, the props actually stop spinning – complete stop.  So let’s say I’m several hundred feet high and want to lose altitude quickly.  If I take the throttle to near zero, I get more than the characteristic wobble that I see in my other vehicles.  This one will just start and uncontrolled tumble out of the air. What I’d like is a parameter that prevents me from actually killing the motors.  But I’m also a little nervous about setting a minimum throttle, because this thing hovers at 25%-30% throttle.  I could see myself setting the throttle minimum high enough that it could never descend again (and give me a fly-away). Thoughts?"

Thank you in advance, Brian","What is your MOT_SPIN_ARMED parameter?  If it is zero it means your props will stop spinning at zero throttle which is what you don’t want according to what you said.  Also, you may want to change your throttle mid position to something more reasonable so that the copter hovers at 50% throttle and not lower. Other than that, I would advise using alt_hold mode and perhaps set a larger descent rate than specified so that you can have a quick but controlled descent without the danger of stopping your props completely. Finally, I know this will be tricky, but make sure your center of gravity is near the middle of the copter to avoid flips ands so forth when it falls without power. (If you are trimming lots on your pitch/ “aileron” channel it may be one indication of bad balance.)"

On my Pixhawk quad, the motors turn at minimum throttle, albeit just barely enough to keep the vehicle level on the ground.  On the Pixhawk hex, the motors come to a complete stop which is what I’m almost certain is happening in the air. I’m not concerned about the COG, because I built the entire thing from scratch and designed it to be radially symmetric (except the battery pack, which is bilaterally symmetric and balanced front-to-back)."

How easily do your motors twist or flex on their arms? With the props off, how much vibration do you get from the motors? Are the props balanced? Do they flex? Best to sort out the actual vibrations than just try to mask them from the flight controller. But better damping will help. A lot of people get by with foam damping, but on solid smooth frames. I have always found better damping is required than foam for smooth operation."

I have installed a DJI  Phantom 1 rx and tx on a quad and the selector switches are showing up as channels 6 and 7…the tilt  slider as channel 5…would like to change 5 to 6. Pehaps a different firmware that would allow this?,So i found the code to change the channel but have no clue how to do it…is there somone here that understands this code that would make the changes then send me the file?  I could paypal you $5 for your time or 3d print something for you…here is the code from DIY drones site… had the same issue. I was able to change the flight mode channel in the Pixhawk firmware but you have to install the Pixhawk Eclipse development environment and change some of the source code. Go into Arducopter Parameters.cpp and Parameters.h and create a new flight_mode_channel parameter. Update config.h to add the Mission Planner accepted values.The flight_mode_channel can then be updated via Mavlink in Mission Planner to be channel 6. Then modify the switches.cpp read_control_switch method to use the flight_mode_channel setting. Like this: uint16_t pulsewidth = hal.rcin->read(g.flight_mode_channel - 1); // calculate position of flight mode switch int8_t switch_position; if (pulsewidth < 1231) switch_position = 0; else if (pulsewidth < 1361) switch_position = 1; else if (pulsewidth < 1491) switch_position = 2; else if (pulsewidth < 1621) switch_position = 3; else if (pulsewidth < 1750) switch_position = 4; else switch_position = 5; This worked for me. There is a minor problem with this fix in Mission Planner which still shows the PWM values for Channel 5 even though the mode is fetched from channel 6. Another possible fix is to copy the PWM values from Channel 6 to Channel 5 in the HAL layer of the PX4 code but I am not up to speed with the way the radio channels work to do this safely

52,Quad flips on landing in Loiter uneven ground?,0,"I have had a few flips after/while landing that I would like a little help understanding. I believe this normally occurs when I am landing in Loiter mode, which maybe I should just stop doing. I like flying in loiter mode. The copter lands, (perhaps landing on sloped ground has something to do with this)  the props do not go into armed idle mode, and part of the quad start to life back off. I then panic and try to disarm with the Tx, which doesnt disarm and possible just makes the flip worse since I am putting in full yaw at that point. I believe that my simplest solution is to to just put it into stabilize with 0 throttle, (thats where the panic becomes a problem)  So this question is more to develop understanding and know if the behavior I am seeing is strange or typical. thanks!

53,Quad flips upon takeoff,1,"I have a quad which I 3d printed using the electronics from a Cheerson CX-20. It flies well however at least 1/3 of the time when I arm the quad and take off, the quad immediately flips over. I generally turn it back over, unplug and replug the battery, rearm it and then it’s fine. What could be causing it to flip. The flip is always in the same direction. Thanks! Bruce","Hi Bruce, I am a beginner as well… you will probably get better advice, Might be good to DL and post your log. If it is truly intermittent then I am not sure what to suggest. A good thing to check would be if you have a vibration problem ( the wiki has good instruction for this). It could be making the accelerometers go crazy. My crashes have been caused by:  a bad ESC (only intermittently bad though) depending on load after 60 seconds it would stop, and I wasnt bench testing for that long, so only found it in the field. Wrong type of prop on one motor -wrong spin direction of one motor. "

When I investigated, found the this is normal behavior of AMP when getting too much vibrations, it lifts like a rocket in auto mode. Now I am close to required vibrations level which accx=-3+3, accy=-3+3 and accz=-15+15. But my accz is too high and even not showing starting at 0 on graph. Can someone look at my log and tells me what is wrong with my quad and how to fix this accz vibrations?

55,"Altitude lost and regained in Guided mode, but holds steady in Auto mode",0,"Hello! When I execute a flight plan in Auto, the quad holds altitude nicely as it moves from waypoint to waypoint.

It seems like it would totally fly into the ground if given enough space. This is not a problem per say, I would like to understand the behavior/logic, and if possible improve it. Thanks, Alex",
56,Transmitter flight mode for using guided mode on ground station or tablet with Tower App,1,"Hello, Still trying to understand automated controls a little better - i did read the wiki page on guided mode. still a little unclear though.

Am i correct that it is not possible to fly with a tablet or ground station without a transmitter (not that i would want to)?","The way I understand it, is if you use a GCS to navigate with by Fly to Here in MP or waypoint flying on the GCS, it’s technically Guided mode.  It’s not a mode you set with a radio. As far as flying without a transmitter, I think it’s possible although I’ve never tried it."

When I do this, the ESC does NOT give a long tone, it gives it’s normal-operation song, and the motors will spin up OK with the throttle; however, after unplugging the battery and re plugging it, all I get are single beeps every 2 seconds, meaning “no throttle signals are detected at the ESC”.

I think I have found something useful in the search for a solution to the dreaded “no throttle signal” beeps ( the ones that occur every 2 seconds, like in the video posted in the entry above). Over the last month, I have tried and tried to get one of my quads out of this “no throttle signal” beeping scenario, with no success.  During that time, I have saved numerous Full Parameter Lists.  Yesterday, I fired up another quad, loaded 3.2.1, did all the calibration stuff per the normal routine, then flew it.  No problems. I then took that working quad back to the computer and loaded various versions of the Full Parameter List (FPL) which were stored during the past month.  I found one FPL which causes the “no throttle signal” problem, and one which causes the quad to start normally.  Excellent! Now all I have to do is compare the two FPLs, figure out what parameter causes the “no throttle signal” problem, and releases us all from this nasty problem.  It wasn’t that easy.  There were about 30 differences between the two lists.  Most of them were items which did not sound pertinent—various gains, for instance.  However, I did try changing a few of the FPL entries in the “non-working” FPL to the value gleaned from the “works OK” FPL:  INS-prod; log bit ask; trim throttle; compass external; circle radius.  None of these changes fixed the “no throttle signal” problem. I bet someone on the development team, or some knowledgeable user on this forum, could look at these two FPLs and tell us all what the magic bullet is.  I will be happy to supply the two FPLs to anyone willing to try…"

By a process of elimination, I found that just two little parameters can cause my APM to issue the dreaded “throttle signal not good” beeps.  The parameters are RC1MIN and RC2MIN, and the bad values are 1321, with the good values 1251. This is good news for those of us who have had problems getting our APMs to proceed with normal arming, as opposed to giving the “beep-every-two-seconds” signal which indicates bad throttle signals. But now this answer generates some important questions:  What can possibly be the reason for this goofy result?  How can the difference between a “good” value and a “bad” value be so small, especially when they both are reasonable values?  Why would the software or hardware even look at these values at start-up? And maybe these are more important questions:  is anyone reading this post?  This forum?  Is there any way to know if my APMs are really a dependable flight controller?"

Well, I figured it out—sometime in the past, I used “end point adjust” to dial down the sensitivity of my roll and pitch performance.  Wrong answer!  I don’t think it says so anywhere in the setup instructions, but you must do your radio calibration without invoking “end point adjust” or “adjustable travel volume” or whatever it’s called on your transmitter. In fact, in the setup instructions, it clearly says “for channels 1 to 4, the MIN must be less than 1300 and the MAX greater than 1700.”  I violated this rule and that’s what caused my difficulty in getting rid of the “beep every two seconds” signal that indicates that the ESC is seeing an “unsatisfactory throttle signal” condition.  When these limits are violated, the APM apparently just impedes throttle signals from going through to the ESCs, thereby allowing the ESCs to generate the “beep every two seconds” warning.  It’s really very simple, once you know what’s happening! I hope that I have described this clearly enough that nobody will have to spend 2 months figuring it out, like I did!"

Been having the same problems as everybody here, and after 3 or 4 weeks of reading through the rcgroup posts (at least 1500 pages) and messing about trying everything that’s been suggested I was about ready to rip out the APM and stick a good old KK board in both of the Quanum Novas (1 PNF, the other RTF). I tried the reset/reboot, but as has been mentioned, all I got was a massive code download. Hair pulling out time, and there’s not a lot left to pull! Then…I found another thread on this site that was a revelation! Praise be, Halleluja!!! This is what it said to do: ""Seems switching between versions using the standard “Initial Setup” screen in MP planner is not enough. You need to erase and reset the APM. (I found this in one of the forums) You have to erase the eeprom which could still have “some memory” of the old firmware, afterwards. AFTER updating the firmware you want click on the Terminal Tab (CLI) Select correct COM Port, make sure BAUD is set to 115200. Click on the Connect APM tab At the command line… Type “setup” press ENTER Type “reset” press ENTER, Type “Y” and press ENTER You should see the response: Reboot APM Physically press the reset button on the APM board (just hold it down for a sec) It will display “erasing eeprom"" Done You can press Enter 3 times to stop the screen from scrolling showing all the present parameters if you want. This process is the “clean” way to change to a new firmware update…or downgrade, if you wish.” So I did all what I was told to do and… Yes you’ve got it, worked perfectly! Armed,Throttled up, everything it’s supposed to do. Did the ESC calibration and now all is well in the world (or the back bedroom at least)! Hope this helps y’all as much as it did me."

Improperly flashed firmware.   Servo plug for tail servo plugged in wrong.   Bad connection between your RC Rx and the APM on the yaw channel.   Bad APM output on channel 7.   Unfortunately I don’t think you can remap the channel 7 output to another channel. You are stuck with it. From what you describe there’s nothing in the Advanced Parameters that would create the situation you are seeing. You should verify that you are actually getting a yaw signal into and out of the APM. Using Mission Planner, hook up your APM to your PC and have a look at the Failsafe page. It will show you in real time what PWM signals the APM is both seeing on each input channel and putting out on each output channel. Check that you see a yaw signal on both the input and output (you might not see an output signal until the APM is armed). This will help you further narrow where the problem is."

I have been working and learning this stuff off and on for 2 years now, and it is time to get a project off the ground. I have done everything to get my tail/tilt servo working, or at least I think I have… Let me explain what I have done… I’m running a APM 2.6 W external compass. The rear rail is powered from the balance plug off a 14v 4s, through a filtered step down converter at 6V The tail servo is plugged into #7 as per the instructions, but no movement after before, or after arming. The props do spin up when throttle is applied. From what I understand the tail servo should move, after arming. It has power, and the metal geared servo is not faulty. I just pulled the servo wires off the #7 pins, plugged a new servo in , and no go. I also tested the installed servo, with a servo tester, and it works no problem. I ran a multi meter on all center power pins, to check for proper voltage to the servo outputs. 6V No problems. Now, I used to get a check board voltage warning in MP, but after troubleshooting all possibilities I found that it was a faulty USB cable. The warning is now gone, after a new cable is being used. APM 2.6 is not faulty. I read on another forum that a guy was getting the same issue, but after disabling the pre arm check his tail servo worked for him. I have disabled pre arm, nothing. Now the questions… Is there something in advanced parameters I should be looking at? I went in there and looked at RC_7, and it is enabled, but everything else is a mystery at the moment. Should I use another servo output? Is it a setting on my TX? (Futaba 9C) I am running a FRSKY 2.4 TX module, along with a FRSKY D4R II RECIEVER in CPPM mode. The throttle does spin up all 3 motors, so *, #2, and #4 signal pins are working, but not RC_7 Where do I start to trouble shoot this thing? Does anybody have a list of things I could check to make it work? I am sure it is just a setting, but it is driving me crazy, and giving my wife fuel to keep saying this is all a money pit. Lol","An update to my problem, which is now resolved.  Having wired the receiver then the servo, I made a rooky mistake and took the second to last wire out of the motor connector, which is actually no 9 Not number 7. DOH! 36 hours wasted but hay I learned something, check, check and check again. "

Second and third time, properly planned a mission by defining way points and set alt to 2 meters only. For safety tied with a string, switched to auto and same thing, it suddenly increased motor speed to very high and tried to fly in different direction and very high but tangled with rope and crashed. Same thing with third time. My 3 motors and 2 esc are completely damaged. Other damages are extra. What am I doing wrong here. Why and where copter are going when switched to auto/Alt hold or stabilize mode. I am now out of spare parts to continue repairing after each crash.

Ardupirate’s old archived site keep files of the old ardupirate’s pages I read that Ardupilot 1.0 was discontinued. But why all the wiki pages were removed…? Yes, I know that there is also a new wiki for the new arducopter based in the new ardupilot 2.5/2.6: * But I need the old wiki pages because my ardupilot + IMU shield was configured and mounted following the old wiki (that I mentioned it does not exist now). I searched it intensively all over the net, but I couldn’t find it, but some pieces of few old wiki Arducopter pages Does anyone out there know how to obtain the old wiki pages…? I have also not clear if I could handle my Arducopter with the latest Mission Planer (for APM2.5/2.6)… Would be recommendable to replace old Arducopter firmware with Arducopirate’s one…?

63,Can't get full throttle,1,"I have a pixhawk on a Tarot 650 controlled by a Taranis. My problem is the throttle, props will not start spinning until I give quarter throttle and it hovers at 3/4 throttle. I have flown this machine with a KK2 board and it hovered at half throttle. Calabrated the esc’s and checked the Throttle hover parameter in Mission planner and that is set to the lowest setting 300. ver.  3.1.4 Sunnysky 2814-11 motors. RC Man Child 30 amp speed controls Apc 12x4.5 props Weight 6lbs Attached is the latest log. Thank you Bob","Solved the Throttle problem! The copter was hovering at 3/4 throttle which caused problems in loiter mode, such as when switched from stabilized mode to loiter the copter would keep gaining altitude. The fix was easy. In basic tuning the Throttle Hover setting was at 300. I raised it to 580 and bingo the copter now hovers exactly at half throttle. The instructions say, “If the copter hovers with the throttle stick above middle position, move the slider to the left by one tick-mark until it hovers at mid-stick, testing as you go. If the copter hovers with the throttle stick below middle position, move the slider to the right by single tick-mark increments until it does.” Mine was hovering with the throttle stick above mid position, I had the Throttle Hover setting all the way to the left. So I ended up doing the exact opposite to what the instructions said. Moved the setting to the right. Life is good now that problem is solved, now on to the next one! Bob"

You know the saying, a picture says a 1000 words. Can you confirm when you flick through each mode on your transmitter, does each one of those move the CH5 on your TX?  If CH5 only moves to three values on the tx then it’s a config issue.  If however you can confirm that there are 6 distinct values generated for the 6 positions then that would be helpful. Are you sure that all bar the first one is set to replace for it’s type.  I highly doubt that it’s the RX.  The TX will generate a PPM siginal and pass it to the TX radio module.  If you have it configured correctly then the PPM signal to the Tx radio module will only see the mixed value.

It really sounds like the config is not right with the symptoms you are listing.  If CH5 visual change on the TX’s screen is not to 6 different values then it is sign that there is some issue with the config.  I can almost guarantee there is something small that has been missed in the config. When I mention replace, you will note on the left hand side of the mixer screen for CH5 in the video you will see an R next to all the values except the first one which from memory has a - instead.  This means that it will replace the value with the one in the config.  The default from memory will add it to the existing value which is not what you want.  The photos will make it much quicker for us to help you verify the config, we’ve all made some basic mistakes in the past where a 2nd set of eyes was able to find it.

Something simple wrong with config? I have to agree with you. My problem seams to be using PPM mode, I hate all the extra wires, I have a feeling if I use the standard method and route each channel with wire it will work like the video. If by the end of the day I cant get it working I will do that. The video seams to only work with the standard method, ie. you hook a wire from channel 5 of the APM to channel 6 of the receiver and it gets mixed with channel 5. In ppm mode you can’t force it to do that the channels are mapped by default the way they are. Oh, my Turnigy 9x uses stock firmware not the er version perhaps thats got the R thing goin on. I really appreciate your help, but it seams PPM mode isn’t very popular, so know body seams to have the experience with it, I was hopeful  I could be the one and make my own video. Damn I hate all those wires! I don’t understand the mixer. Gyro, Flap? Why not mix Ch5 and Ch6, don’t understand how gyro, flap equates to ch5 and ch6. I have a feeling it doesn’t thats why it doesn’t work! I don’t think I’m telling the mixer to mix the correct channels do to the ppm mapping. The mixing of master and slave should be channels, it would make more sense, my quad doesn’t have flaps, alerons etc. If I could just mix the channels I need to mix I’d be good to go."

71,Stationary TB effect = Hula-Hooping,0,"Here’s a weird phenomenon I experienced on my (overweight) TRex500 starting back during original tuning, spring 2014. I slowly eliminated the problem by juggling various parameters, not sure exactly what did the trick. I mention all this now because after a crash and rebuild, I’m seeing the problem again but not nearly as seriously as back in 2014. It would be great to get some expert opinion on what causes the problem and what parameters can fix it. The problem is this: AltHold works fine. Then switching into Loiter the heli rocks to one or the other direction and then commences a stationary roll/pitch  oscillation as if it were trying to swing a hula-hoop! It remains firmly in place while rocking, but if the effect is very pronounced as at the beginning of my tuning days, it does begin to go wild and exiting from Loiter is recommended;>) The effect is surely related to this graph from the log, this one was at the beginning, with serious oscillation: *  Upon hitting Loiter, you can see first Pitch starting to oscillate, followed closely out of phase by roll. Easy to understand how this translates to the hula-hooping, but just what is causing the FC to emit these commands remains a mystery.  With further tuning of the parameters I reduced the oscillation from ±18 to ±4 and later I think even lower as I cured the problem to almost zero effect. Although it still appeared occasionally just at the beginning of Loiter, then died away. I am 99 44/100ths % sure the compass has nothing to do with this, as I did many recals, movings to different locations, etc., even a manual recalibration of offsets that gave quite a bit better accuracy than the MP auto-routine. The compass is now out 1/3 the way on the tail boom far from any interference. GPS is closer in. Vibrations also don’t seem to be the problem, they are within limits. I’d much appreciate any informed opinion, since I am still somewhat in the dark as to the causes and cures, having arrived at the latter mainly by chance! By the way - I did try FW 3.2 on the APM, but went back to 3.1.5",

The quadcopter is an H frame, so it has enough rotational inertia in the pitch and yaw axes, but very little in the roll axis.  Just for test purposes I attached a horizontal beam stretching out from the roll axis and attached little weights to each end, to increase roll rotational inertia.  It worked.  It was the first time I was able to fly for more than 5 seconds.  This is only a temporary solution, though, because the horizontal boom makes the 160 size quad into a 300 size footprint, and it adds a lot of weight. I’m at a loss.  The flight controller is more than capable of stabilizing this quad.  My only hurdle is the completely arbitrary and useless (and dumb!) minimum that the software (Mission Planner or APM Planner 2.0) enforces on the P gains. Any ideas to get past the minimums?"

Also since you have APM flight controller logging is going to be set to low to get any real information about the flight.  Need logging set higher. You may want to do some test flights with logging turned up and see if you can recreate the issue maybe not so far from home though.

I tried to move the right stick (non-throttle) to the right after plugging in the battery in hopes to see the red turn orange/yellow but no joy.  Is something wrong out of the box?

81,Reduced Flight Time,1,I am flying a Cheerson cx-20 with ArduCopter 3.1.2 installed. When flying manually I typically get about 12-13 minutes of flying time. When I fly a mission programming it with Mission Player my flight time seems to be significantly reduced to maybe 10 minutes. Why is this? Is it because when flying a mission it is using more power to keep itself steady when going from one waypoint to another?,"In a mission the speed of copter is fixed as defined in APM configuration when moving across way points. If this speed is more compared to when you were flying in non-mission mode, copter will draw more current and flight time will reduce. You can change speed and increase flight time."

85,Possible to put in PPM mode without jumping pins 2&3?,1,"I have a weird problem with the controller in one of my CX-20s - it seems the Channel 2 RC Input is not working.  I’ve traced it as far as I can on the board hoping to find a poorly soldered pin or something but came up with nothing. This pretty much makes the board useless because I have no pitch control in PWM and with Pin 2 dead, I can’t jump 2 & 3 to put it in PPM mode. Hoping to save this board, I’m wondering about a couple different options:   Is there a “software” way to force it in to PPM mode without the jumper?   Is there a way to reassign input channels so I could skip 2 and get pitch on another channel?   Any other options I’m not thinking about before I have to scrap this board?  ","Well that was easy…I didn’t know it was that simple to remap channels in the parameters list.  I pushed pitch to ch 8 and it works perfectly.   Sucks that I have to lose an aux. input, but I’ll just use that straight off the RX if I need it."
86,X8 Octo APM 3.1.5,1,"Hello guys, I am building a X8 Octo with apm 2.6( AUW 6.5kg, with 18"" props) I am afraid to fly for the first time with the stock pids, do you have any suggestion where and how to start? I installed the 3.1.5 firmware on the APM. Please give me a hint.","My humble experience.   Place your X8 on a flat surface and take off slowly. You’ll see soon how tit reacts. even if you’re on foot in the air. If it wobbles a lot (which I doubt) land it. You can lower the pitch and roll P-PIDs. For example by 20-30%. Your X8 will become “sloppy” ,but you’ll see that when you’re only 1 foot in the air. If you thrust it, put it up to 3 meters, put it in alt hold and do an autotune. Than tune it further. Good luck and happy flying. Paul"
87,My arducopter will only work if connected to mission planner,1,after many failed and hair pulling attempts of getting this drone of the ground nothing worked until today when i plugged it into the pc via usb and opened mission planner after gps was stable i armed it no problem and i was so happy to see the motors spin so i tried it a few times outside…in my bed room even in same spot where it worked before…but nothing. when i plugged it back in they worked…so i unplugged the usb they stopped…tried this again and so i know now i can only fly my droid in my room and connected to the pc…i brought this from a guy on ebay who claimed it was ready to fly and because i had issues trying to get it started had gave me nothing but abuse. is it possible i have a faulty board or something ? many thanks,In Mission Planner are you able to calibrate and see your radio receiver working?

Im lost on this matter and I would very much appropriate it if some one knows how to rectify this. Thanks Richard.",OK Guys don’t worry sorted it now after 3 days then I put this post up a couple of hrs later sorted  typical. Any way for those who have the same issue it was my transmitter settings. I found that in MP the throttle in  transmitter calibration it went from 1100 to 1900 so look on the transmitter in its setting and set the throttle travel from H100 to 150 sorted now in MP I get 1100 to 2099 and plenty of lift power.

96,Gimbal control in different fligh modes,1,"Hi all, I have Hitec Aurora 9 - 9 channels, only 6 of them proportional and would like to control 3D gimbal and Sony camera (full HD, optical stabilisation, cheeper then GoPro Hero 3). I found a smart solution for shutter, zoom and photo sequention via reciever signal to Sony LANC interface. More interesting info here: * But it requires a bunch of proportional channels. My idea of controling all the stuf is to use: standard proportional CH1-4 for roll, pitch, yaw, throttle in stabilise mode 3 pole switch CH5 for flight modes (+ another 2pole switch for TX modes, e.g. [SW1off: SW2 -100,-60,-20], [SW1on - SW2 +20,+60,+100]) proportional CH6 for camera gimbal tilt proportional CH7 for shutter control There is no smart way to control camera pan, roll and zoom in this configuration. So in mission and loiter flight modes I would like to use throttle stick for zoom, pitch stick for camera tilt, roll stick for camera roll and yaw stick for camera pan. I want to use other Aurora switches for TX modes, e.g. slow/quick servo motion for gimball. Means something like this pseudo code: if(flight mode is stabilise) {input channels 1-4 influences outputs 1-4 (1-6 for hexa etc.)} if(flight mode is loiter OR fligh mode is mission) {outputs 1-8 fully autonomous according to gps, gyro, etc. input channels 1-4 control outputs for gimball (9, 10, 11), but not ESCs on O1-8} It is just to get the right point, I know, that I/O numbers are not correct etc. Seems to not to be too difficult, without gimbal auto stabilisation. Is there a way to configure arducopter like this? Maybe someone else would like to use it same way? Hint for further software development, it should not be much difficult and would shift arducopter to next level   Thank you for any thoughts, Stanislav","I can’t quite follow exactly but I guess it’s almost the same idea I got a second ago while playing around with a gimbal and my DX6i. I’ve set up the three front switches (all are 2 position only) ELEV D/R, FLAP/GYRO & AIL D/R to “emulate” a single CH5 with 4 positions. This works great for switching flight modes. So I’ve only CH7 left, which is currently my GEAR switch top left. After playing around with the current APM Planner and finding out that it is doing some crazy things/mistakes with my 3.1 (reverse sets the values to 2 instead of -1, …) I ended up playing around with the MNT values manually in the full parameters list. So I found out that I needed to change MNT_MODE to 2 or 3. But here is the problem: With mode 2 and setting MNT_CONTROL_ values I can set it to some nice default angle and get nice stabilization on copter movement. But I also wanted to change this “default” angle with the CH7 switch. So I needed to set mode to 3. But in this mode it ignores the MNT_CONTROL_ values and just switches between full tilt and zero tilt. Changing the on/off PWM travel positions in the DX6i for the CH7 switch had no effect, although I could watch the PWM values change in the radio calibration UI. The camera tilt still only went between full and zero… So I had an idea. Why not use mode 2 and let CH7 only activate the ability to change MNT_CONTROL_ values? Like this: CH7 off: all normal, all control sticks act normally CH7 on:  throttle controls zooming (in my case both not needed, but would be cool though) using yaw stick changes MNT_CONTROL_Y using tilt/roll sticks changes the MNT_CONTROL_Y and MNT_CONTROL_X for sure you could require loiter mode or auto, but I think this would remove some nice possibilities with this setup  Hope it was ok to add this to the thread instead of creating another one. As far as I understand this may be the same idea at the end? Thanks!"

I’m sure its something painfully simple and would like some more suggestions. We are operating a Mac OS X Yosemite version 10.10.3 but that doesn’t mean we know how to work the darn thing.
104,#2 Motor Won't Spin,1,"I’ve built a Parallax Elev-8 quad, using an APM2.6 controller with external GPS, compass. I’m using an APM poser module to supply power to GPS, telemetry, etc. and power from one ESC to supply power to the rest of the ESC, servo rails. I have a 915 mhz telemetry link between the aircraft and a laptop running Mission Planner - the telemetry link works. My problem is I cannot get the motors to arm.

I fixed the problem with #3, but #2 still souldn’t spin despite checking the wiring. I can plug the #2 ESC control into the throttle channel of the receiver and I can command the motor to run, but when I reconnect the ESC wire back into the APM and reconnect all receiver channels, I still can’t get the motor to spin. This morning, I discovered that if I push the throttle stick to the left the motors will spin - all except #2… I’m about ready to abandon the APM autopilot and replace it with a Pixhawk as it is newer, and I’m hoping I can get  some support from 3DR if I have problems.

I decided to tear down the aircraft to see if I could find any other bad solder joints or connection problems and I discovered a wire had come loose from a connector - one of five wires going from the APM power module to the APM itself. The plug looks damaged and a second wire was loose as well. Since I don’t have a spare and no tools to replace the plug, I’ve ordered a new APM power module from Amazon - hopefully, it will arrive in a day or so."

I was able to get all four motors to pass the Motor Test! But I am still unable to arm the motors.

I tried swapping booms/motors and the problem remained with the boom/motor plugged into the * output port. Then, after some tweaking, I’d get the * motor to spin, but #3 motor would refuse to run.  All of this was while the flight mode was Stabilize. I completely disassembled the aircraft and had the electrons spread out on the floor. I finally decided that it must be a software problem or a faulty APM. So, I put the aircraft back together, made a couple of small modifications: shortened the leads to the APM power module and power distribution harness and added some more vibration dampening. I reflashed the APM firmware, went through the calibrations, including ESC’s everything seemed fine - all four motors spun after ESC calibration. But after power cycling the aircraft, I was back to * motor refusing to spin at all. I switched to Alt Hold mode and no change. But when I switched to RTL, all four motors spun up, as the aircraft was trying to climb to the default altitude for RTL. Switching back to Alt Hold or Stabilize  however caused the same behavior - * motor refused to spin. Based on this, I’m convinced I have a  faulty APM."

If not, make absolutely sure they all calibrated.  I had this exact problem when I did an “all-at-once” calibration and one ESC did not calibrate. I had a similar problem yesterday (one motor vibrating badly and not arming at times) and diagnosed it by connecting the bum motor and ESC directly to the receiver throttle channel.  If the motor spins and follows the throttle properly, then it is something between the APM and the ESC.  If the motor does not spin, then its the ESC, motor, or power wiring.  In my case, it was a prop with the hole in the wrong place.   don’t use the ESC BECs to power the APM, they are usually very noisy electrically and cause GPS and APM problems  Hope this helps.  I am still debugging my SK450 deadcat quad, so far I found:  bad APM power - I used ESCs to power APM loose GPS mount (caused bad compass and GPS readings) APM needed better vibration mounting and shielding of barometer from prop wash bad GPS bad prop low power output from my computer USB - that was a b8tch to find poor battery connections  Good luck."

One motor will “studder” on arming, “sometimes”! I even replaced that motor and ESC, same thing. Did the all in one ESC calibration, did them all together with a lead from the throttle channel. Did them one at a time. Tried an ESC programming card. Finally last night, went through a couple of solder points that I didn’t like the looks of. Seemed to be working. Have not tried yet today. ESC’s can be tricky sometimes. Also a strange thing I noticed. If I armed as soon as the red/blue lights stop flashing (initializing), all 4 motors would start normally. If I waited any longer, only 3 motors arm, with the same one studdering, every time! When all 4 motors arm, the thing flys perfect, all the functions work. This is I’m sure, an APM clone. I will do more testing today, if it stops raining! "

107,"APM 2.6, Tricopter 2.6HV (700size) tail servo settings",1,"Hi! I was wondering how to set the basics for the tail servo? I’ve not flown the tri yet, but by testing it in my hands, it seems that the tail rotor servo is reversed in the compensation, but from the rudder control on the TX it seems correct? And the basic angle of the servo, how can I set it? I’d like it positioned differently at arming, to avoid rotation of the tri during the phase from ground to hover. Maybe it is a part of the auto tuning, but I have not come to that part yet.","Depending upon what tail servo you use and just how the mechanism is constructed you may or may not have to do one or two reversals. The first, and obvious one, is to check your RC Tx. Sounds like you already have checked this. But the other potential reversal is to tell the APM to reverse its own control of the servo. I usually test if this is needed by bringing the tricopter to just barely a hover so that’s it’s just floating on the ground. If it starts to rotate I know the APM control needs to be reversed. This is done by going into the Full Parameter List (under Config/Tuning) in Mission Planner and setting the variable RC7_REV equal to -1. This reverses your Yaw servo channel from the APM’s viewpoint. I don’t believe there’s any way to set the angle of the tail servo in the APM. It’s usually not necessary as the APM provides the angle needed to do what is being requested of it. There are some programmable servos (Hitech comes to mind) where you can set the servo center and ends point if you wish. There shouldn’t be any rotation as the tricopter lifts off if the control reversals are correct. It’s perfectly smooth."

This is the proper way to think of the Tricopter Yaw… Set the tricopter in front of you, with the tail towards you. Turn the Tx on, then the aircraft. Push the rudder (yaw) stick to the right. The rear motor should tilt to the left, which when flying will swing the nose to the right. Push the stick to the left, and the motor should tilt to the right, which will swing the nose to the left. If this is OK then the inputs are OK. Now hold the model (props removed!) and swing the tail sharply to the right - the flight controller should swing the rear motor to the left to correct the error. Swing it to the left - the rear motor should go the the right. If it doesn’t you will need to reverse the gyro. Hope that helps! Ted"

108,APM Tricopter tail servo not working,6,"Anybody with experience in APM Tri copters? I’m sure this has been asked before, but I really need to get this thing off the ground. I’m set to go except one thing. My Tri Copter has no yaw servo movement. The signal seems to have no pass through. The motors spin up with the throttle, and adjust in different attitudes, but no tail servo. I have no where to begin, and need suggestions. It has power supplied from a separate step-down converter to the tail servo, and retracts. I am running an FRSKY module in a futaba 9C with a FRSKY D8R-XP in CPPM mode. The radio calibrates, and all the green bars move through Ch 8, there are no warnings at all. Is there a way to check the firmware while connected to make sure it is tri copter firmware? It seems that when you select the frame type in MP, the tri copter frame is mixed with a whole bunch of others kind of generally… I am suspecting that the tri copter firmware is not going into my board, which might explain no tail servo movement. (maybe) Any suggestions? Thanks Ted","Problem Solved, A simple bad intermittent connection, in two places. That is why it was baffling. No problem in RC-7, I just have to make sure things move correctly, and the tilt is at 5 degrees. I wired it correctly after all of my self doubt  Thank you for your support gentlemen."
109,Please help to diagnose; APM2.6 Fly away during RTL,1,"Hi Anyone, Looking for some advice, What happen during flight? 5 days ago, my Octocopter size 1000 with APM 2.6 FW3.1.5 has Flyaway during RTL by switch activated (This is not first time we test RTL by switch activated, the past had fine with no any issue) and can not regain by deactivating RTL switch to loitetr and Althold mode, so it flew away until hit with the tree at approx 8.5m high.

You needed to switch to Stabilize or Altitude Hold mode. Don’t know why the GPS failed and several times.  Where you too close to the trees that it may have blocked the satellite reception? Mike

110,Manual override failsafe (with companion computer),1,"Hey, Using the Pixhawk with ArduCopter firmware, a companion computer is mounted on the drone and connected to the telemetry port of the Pixhawk. The companion computer is controlling the drone’s movement using MAVLink ‘RC Override’ messages. How can I have the option for a human operator take control with a remote no matter what? Even if the companion computer gets possessed by demons (Sends RC override messages, tries to change flight mods, etc.) the human operator needs to be in control.","You change modes on the rc mode switch and then change it back, quick flip of the mode switch on the rc tx will give you control back.  If the companion computer gets possessed and keeps taking control you can keep flipping the mode switch to fight it for control…and then just kill the throttle in stabilized mode and get it to the ground asap"
111,Pixhawk Pitch PID tuning,0,"Hi All, I’ve been having quite a difficult time with tuning my Tarot t960 with Pixhawk. I’ve had the system flying fairly well and doing missions, but I can’t get the rapid oscillation out of the pitch access, roll is fine. The CG is set perfectly and there is little to no vibration coming from the motors & props. I have the main flight pack (6s 22000mAh) strapped to the bottom and pushed slightly back to accommodate the brushless gimbal holding the Sony NEX5 in front of the battery. So I know there is more weight distributed on the forward and back portion of the hex than the roll so I’ve been trying to adjust my PIDs accordingly. Here is my issue. I started out with the Roll and Pitch (stabilize) PIDs the same, Roll is rock solid. Than I’ve been adjusting the ‘P’ and the ‘I’ down on the Pitch to reduce the oscillation. As I was adjusting bit by bit the oscillation was slowly going away, until gone. Than I recharged the battery to test it, but after the charge the oscillations returned. I then tried to return the PIDs to where they were originally in order to try something new, but the PIDs will not raise. I think it has something to do with the battery voltage. Can’t add Screen shot files. What on Earth am I doing wrong? Please help. (time sensitive) I have 21 screen shots in total. But I couldn’t seem to load them.",

Attached is a Telemtry log showing all this.The change from loiter to ‘guided’  can be seen about 92% of the way thru the log.  Any ideas? Thanks Phil","Hi Phil, I have analyzed your tlog and found what caused the crash and another issue. On you first bettery it was pretty low when you took off. I have speech on my MP set to warn off low voltage at 14.6 V. It was warning low batt most of the time. You were dangerously low when you landed. You need to use your battery failsafe. Then you landed and put in a fresh battery. I also noted a huge voltage drop when you started flying, and that it dropped off pretty quickly. Conclusion : Your battery is too small for the 16 - 17 amp draw you have. OK, The part you have been waiting for. Looks like when you whent to Guided mode the copter tried to pitch down and roll left, there by revving up motor # 4. In fat # 4 goes to max and 2 & 3 drop 1 kind of the same. The action happens at 2:24:40 .  Either your # 4 motor stalled (lost sync) or some thing failed with # 4. The reason it happend when you hit Guided is it called for a quick tilt. Do you have low kv motors with large props & Simon K. They have been known to stall. If the motors work after the crash, I would go with a stall being the cause. Let us know what you find and what your equipment is, batt, motor, props, esc’s, ect. Greg"

It should be right around 5 volts and your voltage is at 4.47 volts, which is really quite low.  Your log also states you are having GPS glitches.  This may be due to low operating voltage for the GPS too, since it gets its power from the APM.  And from your description, you can’t generate enough power to have lift off, which could indicate your motors are not receiving proper operating voltage. You need to take a look at your battery connection and how you are delivering the power to your APM.  Check your electrical connectors and make sure they are clean and making good contact.  Check your power distribution board and wiring harness and make sure the solder connections are good.  Is your battery properly charged?  Is is the correct number of cells and is the current capacity appropriate for your motors?"

127,How To Prevent Automatic Disarm?,0,"I am currently working on an R&D project that involves a quadcopter.  I need to be able to arm the motors and have them not spin, as well as to remain armed for several minutes.  The automatic disarming feature on my quadcopter disarms it after 15 seconds of being armed, and that will not work for my project. I know that there is an option for preventing the motors from spinning when it is armed, but is there one for keeping the motors armed for an extended period of time? I am using an APM-mini 3.1.

128,Altitude Hold not consistently working,0,"The last two flying days I’ve had I ran into some very strange behavior of my hex. Flying has mostly consisted of alt-hold takeoffs, very casual flying around and landing. Sometimes I try the following: [ul] [li]Start in alt-hold[/li] [li]Hover then switch to stabilize[/li] [li]Punch Throttle so copter vertically takes off (no higher than 40 feet directly above me)[/li] [li]Switch to alt-hold to bring down safely[/li][/ul] This is when the strange behavior becomes apparent. Both times this happened to me it was directly after a quick takeoff described above, then feels suddenly like the alt-hold controls have become “less sensitive”, she doesn’t twitch the same way. First time I had MP helping provide real-time info, but the second did not. On both occasions I just stayed calm and brought it down slowly, which was successful but didn’t bring back functionality until I disarmed and rearmed the copter, then I got my alt-hold agility back. Just got home, so I’ll start downloading logs soon and attach as soon as they’re done. Thanks for any and all help.",

I recommend setting your apm from hex to tricopter frame in ‘Y’ formation and connect the signal wires to both your left front and left middle esc’s using a ‘y’ cable and same for right side. A penta with a tail servo is basically a tri with two extra motors. If those two extra motors are near the aircraft cog the FC won’t know the difference. Hope this helps! -BNY"

132,Pixhawk First time Calibration Failure,1,"Pixhawk Calibration Failure - please note - i also posted this in the 3.2 forum, but i have had no replies and believe i should have posted here (unable to delete previous post) My Issue: I can not complete the mandatory setup procedure for first time setup in APM.  When I hit the calibrate button on the radio calibration view I get the error message “radio control is not active or turned on” The pixhawk is flashing the double yellow signal. I am getting a voice message saying “PreArm check: RC not calibrated”.  Setup Details:  I just completed a build of the 3DR 2014 DIY quadcopter kit.  This is my first build and first time using Pixhawk. I am using APM for Mac and have connected directly (USB cable) or via telemetry radios to APM with success.  I (believe I) updated the firmware successfully, and I have successfully bound it to my Spektrum DX7 radio. I have been following instructions on this page: ArduPilot > APM Planner 2.0 > Calibration: Radio Calibration I performed the firmware update, which seems to have worked I performed compass and accelerometer calibrations, which seem to have worked (i did not get any errors), The radio appears to properly interact with the system as judged by the movement of the green bars in the radio configuration graphical view.   I am using this radio Spektrum DX7 7 Channel System w/ AR8000 Receiver Mode 2model SPM7000 (this is a new release of the DX7 ( m * … Id=SPM7000) - which seems more like an updated version of the older DX8, but with one less channel). I bound the radio to the receiver and satellite first and then plugged the satellite into the PixHawk.  I can manipulate the green bars on the radio calibration screen, but i do not see the min and max red lines as i see in the instructions (i am using APM on a mac). i am a little worried that because i am using the new DX7 it may not be supported - however the AR8000 is not new and does receive the DX7 signal. I have tried deleting and re-installing APM but I get the same issue Please help! I’m so close, yet so far! Thank you. Nick","Update - Issue solved. i spoke with tech support at 3DR.  they were puzzled by the problem i was having - apparently it is not common.  They told me that the Mac app “APM is very buggy and they do not trust it”.  They told me the only solution was to perform first time calibration using the Mission Planner app on a PC.   I sure wish i had known this prior to buying - as i have not seen this stated as an issue anywhere.  Anyway - i did find “Mission Planner” to be much more full-featured than “APM”, and it does appear to have resolved my issue."

135,Voltage reading is fluctuating,1,"Hello all, I have a tricopter with an APM 2.5.2 running AC3.1.5.

The mavlink is simple, it’s hard to mess up this simple part in software. If you want to be really sure - let the APM log it for a while.   - but remember you see much less samples /second that way. But I can tell you right away, that this is due to too small capacitor (for your application) on current signal from the current sensor. Also, if you have some switch mode regulators, especially those who work on lower frequencies, will manage to get their load ripple be registered by a current sensor just fine. I use high-end hall-effect  sensors, and these need tuning using R+C to smooth out data, yet get the finest data resolution possible depending on sampling rate. Manufacturers don’t care to do that “right”.  - as some circuits/application sample at ~1Khz, when smooth the data for very accurate measurement - and then you don’t really want very high capacitance. So try adding extra capacitor between I pin and GND, start with 0.1 or 0.47uF  or thereabout,  impossible to say for sure as it depends on sensors source capability and resistor they used."

Less than 1mV fluctuation, if my cheap multimeters are to be trusted (two of them). So it’s either APM’s ADC or something in software that introduces the problem.

When I first plug it in, the battery voltage slowly increases towards the real voltage (15.3V in my case). It takes about 30"" to get there, so I think this indicates averaging. So, I averaged the data coming from a log, while landed and armed. Sure enough, the average is very close to the volt meter reading! Unfortunately I only have ~10 samples, because *, and can’t stay armed and not flying for more than a few seconds. But this indeed looks like a sampling issue, so I should now direct my efforts towards MinimOSD-extra averaging the readings. Thank you Andre, you helped me troubleshoot this long-standing issue! Let’s hope it will be fixed soon  Cheers!"

Current and voltage sensors are basically same technlology , voltage is even simpler. (current sensing is always amplified, because a voltage drop of 3v across a resistor would produce lots of heat at the currents we fly.) Both scale and deliver a voltage representing the measured value. Voltage sensor is usually a simple voltage divider (two resistors).  you input 0…30v , and get out 0…3.3v  which is sampled using a 10bit DAC (I think it’s a 10 bit.)   so your precision is 30/1024= ~0.03v however, if your voltage divider is scaling down from a maximum of 200v , it would mean a step is 0.195 volt. Your AD is 5v , so using a voltage divider that produces 0…3v3 would reduce the precision a lot too. Anyway : still, a capacitor on the voltage sensing pin will do the trick."

Peter","The reason you were getting an LED and beeps before even connecting to MP is the default value is 9 (which you noticed). This means the Arming LED and beeper were already enabled. By changing the LED parameter to 11, you also included enabling the GPS. You are doing it right. I assume you are NOT using the middle pin of each of the three slots, just the inside and outside pins (the middle pin is +5 volts) When you enable the LEDs and power the APM via the USB port while connecting to MP, the LEDs reflect the current state of the APM. Whether you have a GPS lock and if the motors are armed. The beeper shouldn’t be running continuously, just some beeps at arm or disarm. Check that it’s not hooked up to the center pin on A5. Also make sure that the beeper is of a design that it will only sound off if 5 volts is present. It sounds like your LEDs are OK, there’s just something up with your beeper."

The Arm LED (A7) flashes which the motors are disarmed and solid when they are armed. Is this what it’s doing? The GPS LED (A6) flashes when it’s first powered up and looking for GPS satellites and goes solid when it gets a GPS lock. Is this what it’s doing? If your LEDs are working right you could swap out either of them with your buzzer and see if the buzzer beeps when the LED should flash. And with an LED plugged into A5 it should flash when normally the buzzer would beep. Personally, I just use the two LED outputs with ultrabright LEDS and no buzzer. I use a blue LED for A6 and a red LED for A7 to mimic the LED colors on the APM."

If you put a value of 3 in there it will enable the ports for both the motors (Arming condition) and the GPS. A value of 11 adds a beeper if you have one. I only use two very bright LEDs, one red and blue (no beeper), to let me know the APM’s status from a distance. Thus my LED_MODE value is 3. Note that after you change the LED_MODE value, you still have to click on “Write Params” to load it into the APM. Oh, and of course you need an appropriate resistor in line with the LED otherwise you’ll just blow out the LED.

When I yaw left with my stick, the copter pitches forward and opposite also happens when I give it right input. pitch and roll response seems to be ok(it fights my hand when I pitch for/rev as well as roll right/left. I also have the CCW / CW props in the right place and verified with the motor test using the terminal at the Mission planner. My setup is as follow: Frame: * ESC: iPeakA HV-40 40A Opto Escs motors: NTM Prop Drive 28-30S 800KV / 300W Brushless Motor (short shaft version) (USA warehouse) Props: Gemfan 1045 FC: APM 2.6 Battery: 4s 3300 turnigy 25c Please Help… This is my first quad with APM.

138,Arming problem: Bad GPS pos,1,"Hi, Due to bad weather I was testing parachute test copter and deploy tube indoors and tried to spin propels for finding motor  braking time and proper deploy delay. Prearm didn’t go through because of bad GPS pos which is obvious because I was indoors. I tried to disable ARMING_CHECK and GPS_glitch_protection but it didn’t help.

Basically it looks like you’re attempting to arm in Position flight mode which requires a GPS.  Try it in Stabilize and I think it’ll arm ok."

139,Receiver low voltage alarm,1,"Hi everyone , Brand new here. And brand new to the multi rotor world. I purchased a small quad kit that came with a CC3D controller. Built it , flew it. Everything worked great. Now I have purchased an APM board with gps and all the goodies. Installed it last night , installed the latest firmware. My quad was previously wired to power the controller through one of the ESC’s. So I left it that way instead of doing a complete tear down and rebuild and rewiring job. The instructions show to short a jumper on the back of the controller board to power it through the ESC. I did that. Now my radio tells me my receiver is getting low voltage. I removed the jumper and powered the board with the supplied power board and harness. No low voltage alarm this time. Why does it give me a low voltage alarm the other way? It didn’t do that with the cc3d board. Someone on another forum told me there is diode in there that drops the voltage. ??? Why would that be ? I would like to power through the ESC. As the quad is built and configured for that. But if I have to do a full tear down and rebuild. I will reluctantly do it. Thank you for any help or advice","*, Try here: * Regards, TCIII GM"

First, linear BEC not recommended. Second , 2 amps recommended. So did some more digging. My ESC’s are 12 amp units with only a  1 amp linear BEC.  So both things working against me LOL .

The ESC’s are opto-coupled and have a control range of 1120 to 1920us. So you should try to set your throttle channel to send between 1120 at minimum and 1920 at maximum. You can use the RC screen at MP to check these values (which are adjusted on the Servo Setup - Travel on the DX9) then perform a RC calibration as usual on the MP software. If you want to use Throttle failsafe you must bind the receiver in a special way to achieve that (if the receiver has that capability). What I did, was: Change the Travel limit low on the DX9 throttle channel to output about 1000us. With the bind plug on the receiver, power the receiver. Then remove the bind plug and use the bind menu on the DX9 to bind the DX9 to the receiver. When bind is complete (the DX9 says that) power everything off. Restore the Travel limit low on the DX9 to the value that will get you the 1120us. Set the Throttle failsafe value on MP to a value lower than 1120 and higher of 1000. So, if you lose radio contact the Throttle channel goes to 1000us and the Flight Controller changes to Throttle Failsafe active. hope it helps brgds Luis * *"

I compiled the SimonK firmware by myself and did days of extensive testing to ensure the motors do not have any sync problems. The motors do not have a high pole count, they have standard 14 poles and have an apopriate timing advance set. I have tested the motors under load with a programmed switch on my remote which rises throttle from 20 percent to 100 percent by flicking that switch and there were no signs of sync losses when quickly switching between these two and (and other combinations) of throttle. If you would have taken a look into my attached log file you would have seen that autotune raised the throttle to 100% for some reason and then reduced it to THR_MIN and let it there. After this the hex started to roll over, so the crash is directly caused by the throttle output of the APM. Besides this…I have done autotune with these engines around 20 times before without any problems. I do not blame the APM developers for any errors that could be in the code and leading directly to a crash although I have lost several hundreds of dollars in crashes that were not all my fault alone but I expect a help here in the support forums when I do report an issue. Instead of that I get arrogant answers that my motors have sync problems… Andre, the problem was and is that the APM reduced throttle to minimum for some reason and did not raise the throttle up again. The crash is the direct consequence of this."

The pitch axis was very quickly tuned and when it comes to the roll axis id did 1 or 2 twitches and then the hexacopter rolled over the roll-axis (sideways) and fell on the ground (from about 4m of height). Damages so far: All props broken, frame cover broken, 1 motor support broken as well as the motor.  I tried to analyze the problem when reading out the log (Standard+IMU) and I cannot find the cause for the crash. Vibration levels are good, compass-mot was done, accelerometers and compass correctly aligned as well as RC calibrated and ESC calibrated. There was also no power issue, I flew with 2 batteries each 5000 mAh and they had both perfectly 12.3 volts after the crash. Vcc was stable slightly above 5 volts since I am using an external UBEC on the input side of the APM. It sees to me that the APM suddenly raised throttle to 100% and then corrected it by turning throttle down to THR_MIN. At this point the hex rolled over and I had no chance to react by switching back to Stabilize. If anyone could help me with the log? Kind regards! Sven","If we can agree that Rolls falls a lot, without RollIn causing it: Please zoom in on the graph, already at line 10400 you have an unusual pitch of -5deg , and ThrOut is not unusually high. Then Throut climbs rapidly (remeber this is the total throut, you did not log motors)  - and this is not uncommon as it commands more throttle (most likely very much to the falling motor) . Then: at line 10428 , it “cuts throttle”  -  (actually, it reduces it rapidly)  - why ? - because at that point - as logged at 10430, your pitch is -45.67 degree.   It would not make any sense applying more trust, if it worked, that would make it reach extreme speed, so APM is reducing the thrust  - it actually cuts the thrust when pitch is -140 degree …  if it did not, it would fly hard into ground. So OK, I cannot be sure about the “sync” - (yes, it’s it was a hasty suggestion), but I still see a hardware failure somewhere between PWM out and propeller."

I even cooled down / heated up every single ESC while running on my test bench to exclude any bad solder joints on the ESCs.

Best to get them right from the Compact Flash. Second the Compass is needed to determine what direction to fly to get back home.  Since yours is off it will not fly in any auto mode.

Run the compass calibration making sure you have the compass orientation correct for how you have your compass mounted. The motors are magnets and as such effect the compass.  Mount as close as possible to be in the center of the two motors. The calibration should compensate for this interference. Compass Mot will help with interference from running wires near the compass and may not be necessary.

But to do so, you also need to make sure the PID tuning is as tight as it can be.  Also the Alt-Hold PIDs need to be good.  Otherwise you can command a speed with the WP Speed that will cause the system to lose control and possibly crash. Also, increasing the WP Accel speed will help you get up to speed faster."

151,Throttle Oscillation? Quad ups and downs,1,"Hi guys, I recently finished my Pixhawk build. It’s sitting confortably on foam in a QAV400 frame with 1100KV motors, 30A ESC, 3DR telemetry and a GoPro.

Above 50% it climbs and below 50% it falls. Based on the logs you have a left to right oscillation going on.  It seems the copter is over correcting in the roll direction. Mike

Once I had HDOP under 2 the quad armed fine and acted as you described with throttle at 50%. The quad is much more stable now after sliding the basic tuning Roll/Pitch to the left (decreasing values). I also raised the mid Throttle to 600, from 550, with much better response now. Now i just have to figure out how to “soften” throttle between 45% and 55% and i’ll be good to go. Any tips on how to smooth out the throttle curve through Mission Planner?"

Thanks in advance.,"I can’t give you a concrete answer, but I can say that I’m using a Futaba T8FG with s.bus and I have ch9 controlling my gimbal tilt via Aux1 Output. A check of my parameters shows that RC9_FUNCTION = 7, mount_tilt not 1 pass through. So I can confirm at least that with 3.2 FW on a Pixhawk it is reading channels above 8. Beyond that I can’t say for sure weather or not pass through assignment works. I believe that channels 9-14 are automatically assigned to Aux1-6 when available. I believe the only channels you can “map” are the first 4 flight controls. Can you post a copy of your parameters? Regards, Nathaniel ~KD2DEY"

155,AutoTune Performance on a Large Multirotor Quad,1,"* The first run using the AutoTune function with our 850 size quad. Specs are as follow: CF frame 850 mm (33.5""), APM 2.6 with GPS module and firmware 3.1, Tiger Motor MN4010-11 475Kv, TM 45A esc’s, 16x5.5 cf props running off 4S 5800 mAh. For this initial AutoTune run we used cheaper HK cf props just in case of a mishap, and will rerun again with the TM cf versions. C-clamp optional… The entire AutoTune flight took right around 7:00 ground to ground, which included a brief system check flight and some interrupted drift corrections while in AutoTune mode etc. The AutoTune function performed perfectly, and the quad has rock solid flight characteristics. Very similar to HoverFly Pro in stabilize mode, and GPS is fantastic. We have used the APM 2.6 on other large quads with AutoTune and GPS with absolutely no problems whatsoever. Just need to try the Cadillac model Pixhawk next.",Here are the PID values after the AutoTune was completed

I’ll see if I can find something that works better. The other thing I don’t get, is how it would get to the point where I can’t even bring it back in Stabilize - as I mentioned in my original post, sometimes even with full back pitch it will barely start coming back.

158,Pixhawk Loiter not stable / Toiletbowl,1,"Hello My setup is:  Quad based on DJi F450 Extended Aluminum arms instead of original plastic arms 4 x MT4006 T-Motors 4 x T-Motor 40A Pro ESC Futaba FASST receiver 4S Gens Ace LiPo Pixhawk with FW 3.15  Problem is: flying great in stabilize and Alt-Hold. When switch to Loiter it is stable. The problem starts once I maneuver…  When flying fast forward it is ascending fast even though the Throtle remains in middle position Then when stopping the movement it starts moving around like it has life of it’s own and then gets into growing toilet bowl circles.  Here are the compass offsets that I get: PARM, COMPASS_OFS_X, 157.3412 PARM, COMPASS_OFS_Y, 391.8282 PARM, COMPASS_OFS_Z, -73.18955 PARM, COMPASS_OFS2_X, 0.000000 PARM, COMPASS_OFS2_Y, 0.000000 PARM, COMPASS_OFS2_Z, 0.000000 I attach the log file, help with diagnosis would be greatly appreciated.",When you are in Loiter and push the stick straight forward does the copter fly at an angle or does it fly dead straight? Typically when you have a toilet bowl effect it’s caused from your Mag getting interference. I had this problem so I made a bracket that mounts the GPS/Mag about 4 inches off the top of the frame. Another Param to look at is your PID settings for Rate Roll I and Rate Roll Pitch I.  It will hold a lot better with higher values. I think it’s almost double than what Rate “P” is but don’t quote me.
159,Pixhawk battery monitoring Troubles,1,"I am experiencing trouble with the current sensor. I am using the attopilot 180a. In mission planner it does not detect any current flow.

In my case, I feel that my voltage reading was good but, I could not get the Pixhawk to read the current. After all the time with tech support I decided that I would chase down the problem myself. I tried downloading qground control to see if I could get a reading on that planner. It required me to format and flash a different firmware on t9 the Pixhawk. Once That was done I saw that it read the current draw. I then formated and flashed bacteria to use Mission Planner. Once I connected up I had the current reading. With a bit of tweeting I had it up and running great. Now for you, I don’t know if this is your problem. I think though that it would be advisable for anyone to format and flash on first setup.

One time I was flying with the GoPro facing down taking pictures every 5 seconds and so it was probably at least 20cm away from the antenna. I then flew the same mission again and tilted up to up the Gopro to video the same flight. This time the Gopro was probably 10 cm from the gps antenna. When I put it in auto mode it would just flyaway. Same thing when in Loiter.  I never crashed but came close. I did some research I found out the GoPro can sometimes interfere with GPS antennas when they are in close proximity. I found out some people had good luck wrapping their GoPros in aluminum (aluminium for the rest of the world). The aluminum acts as a faraday cage and blocks much of the spurious rf emissions from the processors in the GoPro. Also make sure you have Wifi turned off as this will interfere with 2.4 ghz remotes which most people are using these days. There is a very simple way to test for this because every situation is different. Put you quad out in the open and watch the telemetry for HDOP with the GoPro off. Let the GPS settle probably 3-5 minutes. Then go over and turn your GoPro on while recording video and see if your HDOP drops. Also look at the map on mission planner to see if you are close to where your craft is. Now with telemetry recording fly around in Stabilized mode mentally remembering where you where flying or hovering. Then go back and see if the telemetry record shows a drop in HDOP and a jump in location. In my case the GPS would go off by a more than a 100meters. You will see this as a straight line when watching the mission back on mission planner. Let me know if there is something you aren’t clear about and if you want to see a picture of what my GoPro looks like wrapped in aluminum foil.
162,Battery failsafe settings,1,"Greetings to you all! Setting some failsafes on my quad at the moment. Using pixhawk… I want to set RTL for the battery failsafe, but I m wondering what would happen in some occasion if the battery wont last for that comand. Will it land by itself at that point or will it try to return home and maybe if battery is not enough to crash? Thanks in advance for any kind reply.","FS Battery could be triggered by 2 tests. One is battery voltage (protect the battery), second one is mAh remaining in the battery (keep enough energy in your tank to go to next petrol station). If one of these 2 tests are positive, it will trigger the FS action (RTL,…). But it “only” trigger the action. So for example, if RTL is engage due to Volt limit and the battery do not have enough mAh in stock, the battery will give up during the fly back. So up to you to define the right criteria of the FS to be able to execute the action. My personal setup is:  Fence defined FS mAh defined to be able to come back home if the copter is at the fence (=max distance from home). Hope it help. "

163,Logs only reach so far. End at 300m hight,1,A rather funny story. I flipped the wrong switch and was waiting for my tricopter to come back to me while it was autotuning away and gaining a lot of height in the low clouds. Crash was inevitable and the crashing unidentified vehicle was picked up by the police resulting in an article in the newspaper and it even showed on local news on TV.  Now I’ve retrieved the “aircraft” at the police station and I am very happy no one was harmed. Checking the logs they only show what happened until it was descending and was about 300m above ground. Any ideas as to why? And if there is any way I can retrieve more data? Of course it was not unarmed in a proper way.   I also noticed that at the same time it starts descending it also starts oscillating in all axis. Here is the log of that.  I was using sonar which is giving strange readings all the time between 1 and 9 meters even when the copter is far up in the air.,"Phil, Glad it turned out ok. So it looks like the vehicle was in stabilize mode the whole time and the throttle goes to zero while the vehicle is still at 550m.  In stabilize mode with throttle at zero no more attitude control is done so the vehicle will normally tumble.  My guess is your vehicle’s aerodynamics mean it stays relatively flag even while falling.  lucky!"

165,Quad with no pitch and roll control,1,"Hi, I have an APM 2.5.  It is about two years old.  It has been on the shelf for a year or so, but I have had it flying on older firmware (I believe it was 2.8 or 2.9). Today I spent the day getting things up to date on it again.  I put on 3.1.5, went through the wizard and did all the calibrations.  Everything appears to be working well.  If i go to the radio calibration it calibrates fine and all channels move. As the sun was setting I figured I would give it a flight before it got dark.  It armed fine and I went to take off in stabilized mode.  The quad lifted off as expected but began to drift towards me as I was downwind of its starting position.  I pushed forward on the stick and nothing happened.  I landed the quad and picked it up.  Gave it half throttle.  If I move the quad around I can feel it’s stabilizing but if I put in any input on the roll or pitch it does nothing.  The RPM of all motors sound the same, and I can’t feel any pulling in any direction. I tried to get a log file but mission planner says it cannot get log list. Any ideas… Thanks…","Today i wiped the eprom.  Did the wizard setup again, and added my PID’s from before and the pitch and roll are working.

In the parameter list, the voltage to trigger the battery failsafe is 14V and the battery voltage to trigger the warn in the Mission Planner is 9.6V.

Yes, it does make the transmitter more expensive… … but if you have a prototype project with a high chance of crashing just from a very new flying experience -res-use the cheapish turnigy stuff for that prototype project and use your “finer” equipment in tried and true models. Also the turnigy tx/rx hasn’t got the best range (300-500m) to begin with, updating the TX/Rx will also increase your range, increase safety and generally (theoretically) make flying much smoother. I’m still such a noob on flying though I couldn’t tell yet, and my first quad was seriously over weight. Although I have 30 yrs experience running nitro and electric offroaders on AM, moving to 2.4GHz was definetly a step up in stability, moving to futaba fasst with fast servo also a step up. maybe smaller models will show and tell difference in reaction time with flying on Turnigy Tx/Rx VS for example FrSky Tx/Rx"

Getting the FAA to budge on commercial sUAS won’t be helped by a big membership in the Fly-Away club, especially with injuries/damage.

Basics is that the module slot/size/pinout is of the type manufacturer JR/Spektrum uses. Not all JR compatible modules fit perfectly, not even FrSky, sometimes a few people report a smallish collision between the pin header in 9X and the module plastic housing. It’s easily solved with a screwdriver and small blade. I didn’t have that issue though. You can also switch to other frequency, doesn’t have to be a 2.4GHz Tx/Rx module either, all depending on your needs. As for other brands I have not searched much, I read so many people liking the FrSky I settled for it pretty soon. But known brands making modules for this is JR (ofcoz), Orange, Assan, FlySky, FrSky. There are probably more out there… as long as they say they are JR/Spektrum compatible it’s likely it will work fine. One thing to know though, when you remove Turnigy Tx module you will have to snip antenna wire or desolder it since Turnigy uses module bay for the Tx but use the fixed antenna mount on radio. If you go with snip method, atleast unscrew the cover for module and snip wire near the board so you can re-use it later on. When you buy a module you will sometimes have a choice, to buy a 1.) module WITH antenna fixed on module (easiest, but more costly?) or… 2.) Have a system like Turnigy (two part tx + antenna) or… 3.) Internal shrink tube’d board inside(!) radio housing and re-use the radio’s antenna slot… leaving the module bay empty. Decisions decisions   Yeah, I definetly agree what you said about Turnigy original lacking FS, true that, had a harrowing experience with a friend and his copter… it just… sailed away! …over forrested area …heading for town! With a bit of running he managed to re-gain control though. It was a lesson learned @ 180 (heart) bpm -watch out for cell-phone towers   even if nature is the view that we where trying to capture was distractingly cool. It was fine in the beginning, doing a range check and all… but with increase in altitude I’m guessing it got caught in towers Tx beam, totally overpowering copter’s Rx."

Another solution (that requires hardware modification) could be the connection of a redundant apm, slave, and activated on demand, when the failure is detected. But this last idea is too much drastic, do not consider it.","hi guys, i finally solved by proper covering the barometer. now i have no problems."

172,Quadcopter constantly gains height during Loiter,1,"Hi all, I have a problem with my Quad which uses APM 3.1.5 as flight controller. Yesterday I exchanged cheap plastic props agains proper CFK props. Before the change, the quad flew excellent. Alt hold, Loiter, Auto mode - everything perfect. I only changed the props against CFK props (after properly balancing them) and now I’m suddenly facing strange problems: In loiter mode the quad will no longer hold altitude. It will stay at the same position but constantly gain altitude (about 10 metres) after which it suddenly will rapidly lower altitude again only to repeat the process. This worked flawlessly before - before the change in props, it would hold altitude without any problems. I have one of the old APM boards which did not came with a case yet. However, I have properly protected the barometer and it worked flawlessy before changing the props. I only have this problem with the altitude, everything else works great and it flies much better with the balanced CFK props than before with the cheap (although still balanced plastic props). This is very strange and I’m wuite lost why this should happen. I have attached a log. Maybe anyone can help? This would be greatly appreciated. Please help  Many thanks and all the best, Michael","…said that, I did some more analysis and I think I know what might be the reason. The old props (cheap plastic slow-fly props where 9x4.7), the new cfk props are 9x5. Still, with the cfk props I need considerably more throttle to hover. Thus, I think the thr_mid value might simply no longer be correct and thus the copter raises when I’m going into loiter, since I’m out of the dead band. Does that make sense? All the best, Michael"

When I plan missions in APM Planner 2 the do_change_speed command works. So you could simply use APM Planner but I use many of the functions in Mission planner that is not yet available in APM Planner 2 so in order to still use mission planner I devised a workaround: Use APM Planner 2 to plan your mission and enter waypoints, the do_change_speed commands etc. as you would have if you were using mission planner. Then write the flight plan to your drone, disconnect from APM Planner and reconnect with Mission Planner. Read the flight plan into Mission Planner from the drone (so you can see the flight plan) and then simply fly the mission via Mission Planner.

Andrew your suggestion works (though I could not get it to work before updating mission planner). The latest Mission planner update seems to have solved the problem. Using the first parameter field works. The fix seems to be that all fields have been populated with a “0” by default. Do change speed command works ok. Waypoint transitions are very rough at higher speeds. If you are planning on passing waypoints at high speeds be sure to allow plenty of altitude. When the copter reaches a waypoint at say 15 m/s and needs to turn around the whole manoeuvre is performed extremely violently (no slow down or graceful transition) and an altitude drop of several meters sometimes takes place before recovery. I would also like to upgrade to 3.2 since the “gracefulness” have apparently been improved but I don’t know if it is safe yet… Was hoping a stable release would have been available by now. In the mean time I guess I will have to stick to 3.1. It’s not pretty but it works ok.

176,Do_Change_Speed command causing Auto and RTL to fail,11,"Hi Everyone I am flying the APM 2.6 and cannot seem to use the do_change_speed command correctly. According ot the Wiki * the versions before 3.2 use the first column for the speed setting in m/s. When I use a do change speed command the auto mission makes a really scary erratic stop at the point that command is issued. The moment that happens the copter (Y6B) simply loiters at that location and when I engage RTL it does not respond at all. The only way to move the machine is to use loiter, alt hold or stabilize. Re-engaging auto or RTL causes machine to hold position. I have a theory but it is likely wrong: My trying to change the speed somehow sets the speed to 0 or very close to it causing no movement using waypoint navigation like auto or RTL… The speed I tried to set was 2 m/s. I tried entering it in both blocks. Made no difference. I do not know how to analyse the log files to see what is happening. If someone can explain to me how I will post it here. I need to be able to use that command often. Thank you in advance for any assistance!",Thank you for that info. Perhaps I should give it a try.

182,Potentiometer setup for tuning or servo control,1,"Hey guys.  First of all, fantastic work putting the APM platform together.  After playing with a Phantom for a bit, I put together a custom X6 setup using the APM 2.5 board a lot of wiki reading, and watching some videos, and amazingly enough, it flies.  Pretty well even. Anyway, I was playing around with PID tuning, using the standard tutorial, and not having much luck.  I set my potentiometer of choice to channel 6 on the transmitter, set the tuning option to the standard P roll/pitch, and found that, even though I’d calibrated my radio, and in the radio cal screen it showed the potentiometer sweeping over its full range nicely (around 1050 to 1900) and smoothly, the PID settings basically snapped between the lowest and highest settings oddly, right around the midpoint. Later, playing around trying to get the pot to control a servo, I found similar behavior.  I set the servo to be on A10, and activated the manual camera tilt mode (controlled by channel 6), and the servo was jumping all over the place.  As I swept the pot through its range, the servo would go from its min to its max multiple times, and each time over a very narrow range.  For example, it would be at one end from 1900 to 1700, then sweep through the whole servo range from, say, 1700 to 1680 or so.  Then do the same thing again a little further down the dial, then again, etc. I make sure that the gimbal controls were inactive when playing with PID tuning, and the PID tuning was set to None when playing with the servo.  I have an APM 2.5 board loaded with 3.1 firmware.  My transmitter is a Turnigy 9x, flashed with er9x firmware.  I looked over the er9x configuration, and it’s extremely basic…I’m not doing anything fancy.  In the er9x screen, it shows the pot sweeping from -100 to 100 smoothly, and the radio cal screen in mission planner shows the same thing (smooth sweeping across the PWM range). Any ideas what to try next to narrow down / debug what’s going on?  Thanks in advance.","Oops, nevermind.  I could have sworn I recalibrated the radio after the last configuration change.  But, of course, I must have done it without the potentiometer channel active or something.  After another recalibration, the servo is working fine.  Still learning how to diagnose problems… "

186,Heading does not change in Auto mode,1,"I swapped my hexa for a y-hexa configuration.  Everything is working great in the new frame, in stabilize or loiter mode the pilot can yaw, pitch and roll, etc.  With 4S, 8000 mAh batteries and 11"" props the vehicle zooms through the sky like a hive of angry bees. I am running APM 3.1.5 and have used both APM 2.0.11 and Mission Planner 1.3.10 to create waypoint missions. In Auto mode, however, the vehicle never changes heading.  I can set the WP_YAW_BEHAVIOR to “face next waypoint”, but the vehicle heading stays in whatever orientation it was in when I change it to “Auto” mode. If I use DO_SET_ROI during the mission it results in the same thing.  The vehicle heading stays in whatever orientation it was in when the mission started. I know I’m missing something stupid here, I just can’t figure out what.  I would like to be able to use the DO_SET_ROI feature to manage the yaw during the mission so that I can manage the camera angle. Interestingly, I had this working great on my original hexa frame, but when I re-flashed the APM from 3.0.1 to 3.1.5 I decided to re-initialize all of the parameters and tune the vehicle from scratch. Since then, the vehicle won’t change its heading in Auto mode. Any ideas?","I went ahead and upgraded to 3.2 (so I could set ROI once and forget it).

187,Motor PWM too high when safety switch is pressed,1,"I’m running AC3.1.5 on a Pixhawk. I’ve encountered a couple problems with the PWM output range for the ESCs. Prior to pressing the safety button, the controller doesn’t output any PWM signal by default.  This is OK, although slightly annoying since the ESCs beep a lot because of it.  I can add “pwm disarmed -c 1234 -p 900 ” to the startup file to prevent this. The big problem is that I immediately get a 1.171ms PWM output when I enable the safety switch.  This is prior to actually arming using the transmitter.  This is in the range where my 30A Opto ESCs will spin the motors. When I’ve set the disarmed PWM, they will start to spin while I still have my hand on the button and cannot be stopped until the button is pressed again.  With the default behavior (no PWM when disarmed), the ESCs will not accept the 1.171ms PWM without getting a shorter PWM first and beep quickly. I’ve tried adjusting THR_MIN, but it doesn’t seem to have any effect.  What parameter do I need to change to get a lower PWM output?",Solved.  The throttle PWM has to be adjusted to the correct range on the transmitter before doing calibration.

189,Alt Hold ... not,1,"Has anyone any ideas re altitude creep. I’ve tried settings for AltHold P from 0 to 2 and nothing I do will make my Hex stay put. Engaging alt hold and it just keeps going higher and higher until I have no choice but to throw it back into stabilize and bring it back. If anyone has any ideas I’d appreciate it, I’m reluctant to try any other modes until I get this resolved. Log attached. Ignore the Flight Error 16 - this is related to Pos Hold which is the next mode on my switches (pulled down when I should have pushed up to get back to stabilize). The altitude is also lying. When I selected Alt Hold I was between 2 and 3 metres altitude, when I took control back it was up to almost 6 - as high as the top of the house basically - notice that my DAlt is constantly increasing - my hover position is approx 50% stick (but I have a trim throttle value of 682) so I’m coming to the conclusion that the DJI E300 system on 3S batteries is grossly underpowered. Notice when I land that it is -ve … I am not touching the throttle after engaging alt hold but my DAlt is gradually rising, this is clearly the issue but what is causing DAlt to increase with no input from me. I’m going to try increasing the PWM around trim dead zone for RC3 and see what effect that has. My controller is between the top and bottom plate of my frame (DJI Flamewheel F550) so is pretty well shielded from light and propwash - although the props blow the grass around even from 3 metres up. I’ve noticed that just sitting here on the desk next to me that the altitude gradually creeps up, I’ve read a few posts from people that have seen this but found no solution.","I’ve managed a little progress but this raises an issue that may or may not be known. The AltHold seems tied into the attribute THR_MID - this parameter is not automatically updated. Get this parameter set right and the copter will stay put - BUT - the throttle mid point should increase as the battery decays. When I started a flight I had a midpoint of 510 (TRIM_THROTTLE), when I finished 7 minutes later it was 640 by which time the copter would climb when put into AltHold. As an experiment I entered 630 into THR_MID and hey presto select AltHold and the copter stayed put - so I know this value is the cause of my issue - it thinks my high stick is an indication that I want to climb. If I reduce the stick it stops climbing but then when you release the althold it drops like a stone unless you can remember where the stick was when you entered the mode. Also this THR_MID value will need to change depending upon your payload, it’s impossible to guess and yet impossible to set in flight like a ‘trim’. Since AltHold has an impact on many other modes how do I fix this - can it be fixed - why does it even need to be - why can’t the flight controller simply try to maintain the pressure at the time the mode was set ? it basically becomes an autopilot for the throttle any how - why can’t it base its mid point off the throttle sticks position when the mode is selected and then work 20% either side of that if the pilot wants to change altitude ? On another note I do still have altitude creep as reported by the barometer, if I sit it on the desk and ‘power it up’ I’d expect it to set altitude to 0 - but it doesn’t. In addition in the time it has taken me to type this I’ve managed to climb by almost a metre. this can not be attributed to atmospheric pressure, the pressure here has been pretty stable at 1021hPa since 08:50 this morning. I’m fortunate enough to be almost next door to a major international airport and based on it’s METAR data my flight controller barometer is reading low by 1500 pa. I definitely need sonar on this thing I think, there is no way that I’d trust this ‘barometer’ to land the copter. I’d love some ideas here. Am I seeing issues or problems that I’ve created somehow."

I’ve been annoyed with my loaded IRIS plummeting down from AltHold when switching to Stabilize, the throttle correction needed to avoid it is significant (@65% throttle to hover in Stabilize, about 45% throttle to maintain altitude in AltHold) and the timing needs to be perfect if you want stable video.

Indeed I had already identified THR_MID parameter as the problem. I also identified that the use of 3S batteries was causing me to hold the throttle inordinately high to maintain hover for the camera / gimbal battery weight I was carrying. The flight controller basically thought that I was asking it to climb because of my stick position, you need to tell the controller where your ‘mid stick’ position is using a parameter called THR_MID but you cannot do this in flight. The problem with THR_MID is that it is ‘fixed’ and takes no account of battery condition (charge) and how it decays during a flight. The reason I had the issue is that the developers want to provide the pilot with the ability to increase or decrease the altitude that the controller tries to stay at - by moving outside the 20% band around mid stick in the appropriate direction. So THR_MID is used to tell the controller where mid stick is, so that it can set this 20% band - the problem is that mid stick increases as battery volts drop or decreases with a fully charged one - but THR_MID does not change. THR_MID remains the same throughout your flight but your mid stick or ‘hover’ position does not, it also doesn’t change if your payload does, it isn’t dynamic, nor is it related to the stick position when the mode is selected - and I think that it should be. There is an attribute that tries to show the hover position but this seems to be the hover point shortly before you land - which with me is when the battery is due for changing so its value is overly high and of little value. I’ve proven the behaviour of THR_MID conclusively with flight tests. I partially fixed it by moving to 4S batteries and these permit me to hover between 44% and 57% - this seems to keep althold happy, I now I have a THR_MID setting of 510.  I have an all up weight of 2.5kg including camera, gimbal, battery etc etc which ‘theoretically’ is outside the boundaries for the DJI F550 - but if I can’t carry my camera (an AEE S70 Magicam) and gimbal it serves only as a toy and has no value to me - finding a HD camera that’s lighter is unlikely. I could use a smaller battery but I’m not interested in anything with a sub 10 minute flight time. With a 4S 6.6Ah Multistar I get 17 minutes 40 seconds before it’s time to land, with a 3S 4.5Ah I get 7 minutes 30 plus the flight characteristics suck. I’m told that althold has been overhauled somewhat in V3.2 so I’ll wait for that before taking matters into my own hands. I intend to modify the code to write my current throttle position into THR_MID if V3.2 doesn’t address the altitude hold."

192,Loiter Turns Does Not Work In This Mission,1,"I have a mission where I’m looking at a desired object below the copter. I want to briefly move the camera back to level and do a loiter turn to see the panorama, then again look down at the desired object and continue my mission. The loiter turn does NOT execute in this combination of commands. I’m running AC 3.1.2 (yes, downlevel from 3.1.5). Loiter turns work well without the ROI after the delay. See snippet of mission below. I bracket the loiter turn with delays; lines 15 and 17. I then do an ROI on line 18 to again look at my desired object before continuing to the next waypoint. The loiter turn on line 16 does not happen. The delays happen, and the camera tilts properly, just no loiter turn. Bug, or my misunderstanding on how the command processing happens? Tim","Ah, never mind. Looks like the ROI on line 14 takes precedence over the loiter turns on 16. It takes precedence, I would imagine, until either another ROI command happens or the next WP is reached."

Once all this was done I was getting good arming and motors were spinning nicely when armed and performing together.  I put the props back on and ready to go!

Flashed latest 3.1 code, ran through full calibration and it barely gets above arming speed at full throttle. Now, I can hold it in my hand and force it to yaw or pitch and sure enough it will fight me to level out. I tried a recalibration of all esc using the built in functionality in ardu and after the levels are set I can bring it up to full speed - so I know the ESCs are working and the ardu code is able to spin them at full throttle.

ALTHold mode works perfectly.",Ok here is some advice you may not want to hear. The apm flight controller is not a plug and play system. The firmware and manual are open source meaning that no one gets paid everyone is a volunteer. Most of the used quads with apm FC sold on eBay are sold because people want plug and play and ars not geeky. My advice is if you want to use the apm then you will have to knuckle down and learn how to set it up and tune it. If that’s not for you buy a Phantom which is much more plug and play but still needs setting up and tuning. Horses for courses. Down load the latest version of mission planner plug in  the apm go to terminal and connect. Type in erase. You have now done exactly that which is to remove the firmware. Whilst the apm is connected you can also push the reset button for good measure. Now go to initial set up and follow the screen instructions on the wizard EXACTLY including setting the ESc top and bottom and the failsafes. If you do this you and follow the checks you will have a copter that will take off and hover. Now you will need to do trim and trim save which is explained in the manual. Then you will need to do an auto tune. Again it’s in the manual. All of this will need to be done accurately and usually takes me a whole day.

In later versions of MP there is a set up wizard. Just follow the wizard to do the set up. If you try to arm the apm and it fails it is likely that the pre arm test is failing. To find our which tests are failing turn on tx remove flight pack plug the USB in and connect. Go to the flight screen the one with the ah on it wait for gps lock solid blue light then try to arm. The first item to fail will come up on the screen. Fix that then try again and so on until you fix them all. In the manual this is listed under pre arm check failure.

Twitching motors and poor althold performance are the main issues. It also dosn’t help a lot that there is no real explanation of how to tune the relevant parameters.

Michael","Althold is highly dependent on GPS signal, so if you are performing these test inside it is likely that you get a bad result. The APM determines altitude by a combination of barometer values and GPS altitude. Try repeating the test outdoors with good gps HDOP values. If you still have an unstable althold, PID settings might need to be tuned. I have also noticed that a balanced machine will perform alot better in this mode, determine the mid point betwwen your props and move your gear so that the copter will balance in that midline. More info in the APM page: *"

Michael","As far as I’m aware Alt Hold doesn’t use GPS at all. “Note: The flight controller uses a barometer which measures air pressure as the primary means for determining altitude (“Pressure Altitude”) and if the air pressure is changing in your flight area due to extreme weather, the copter will follow the air pressure change rather than actual altitude (unless you are within 20 feet of the ground and have SONAR installed and enabled). Below 26 feet, SONAR (if enabled) will automatically provide even more accurate altitude maintenance.” If I’m reading your picture correctly your barometer is dropping 4mtr when you throttle up? If that’s the case then to me it would imply the prop wash is effecting the barometer. Do you have a picture of your setup?"

This sort of thing is usually caused by vibration issues. The easy test is to plot BarAlt against RelAlt during hover or gentle maneuvering. If they don’t track almost exactly, it’s an indicator of vibration. BarAlt uses only the baro while RelAlt mixes in the accelerometers. The true test would be to turn on logging of the IMU and see what the Z values are."

RichardHamilton","* I dont have the dx8, but, I kinda think that most of the newer radios are very similar…If your radio allows you to create CUSTOM SWITCHES, then create six new custom switches… use the three - way switch and another, that you prefer… then create six, using a formula similar to (x)and(y)  or AND or something like that. then go down the list,   custom sw1 = 3pos(a)   AND (ELE) custom sw2 = 3pos(b)  AND (ELE) custom sw3 = 3pos©   AND  (ELE) CS4  sw4 = 3pos(a)   AND (!ELE) CS5  sw5 = 3pos(b)  AND  (!ELE) CS6 sw6  = 3pos©  AND  (!ELE) then goto the MIXING screen and on channel 5 (or whatever channel you want, as long as it is wired to APM channel 5)  create the following mixes, (all on the same channel, each new line will be + channel 5  and source the custom switches,   SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4, SW5, SW6 after you set up the mix with the custom switches, then calibrate the ppm while looking at the mission planner screen, and the radio is on the mix screen, and adjust the weight, or ratio… to adjust/move the ppm and flight mode… hopefully this makes sense… anyways, this seems to work a bit better then the methods I have seen on youtube… it frees up a channel on the receiver…  now you can program a available channel to ELE, and have it control something different, something else. keep in mind that if you use ELE for something else, it will also change the PPM / flight mode too…ie  maybe have a light come on when you are using the ‘second set of flight modes?’  or something… anyways, good luck"

This was described in the ardupilot wiki as an alternate method and it works fine. One nice additional thing I was able to do with the Dx18 was to set up the flight modes to reference the same two switches and then name them according to my assignments in APM.

I have about 15 years of RC experience (planes and helis) and my thought is that this was a radio glitch (pitchin and rollin spikes are way out of the max value I can input with the sticks) but I was hopping someone with more experience in log reading could confirm this.

Cars and planes cannot do this, and are less prone to such glitches. The solution, i think, is to take off in loiter, with HDOP being less than 2m. You then don’t get a correction in the air when changing from stabilize to a GPS based mode"
201,Flyaway full speed left,5,"Hello: I’ve been following this forum for a long time but this is my first post. I’m flying with a perfectly stable and tuned quadcopter with 3.1.5.

Graphing gps_lat/long vs rollin shows that the coordinated only change after rollin spike to -74. So gps error seems to me to be unlikely. I’m starting to think I have a darker problem than a simple radio jitter.

GPS location is also an indicator, it can at time be really inaccurate! The issue is that you can fly under the control of GPS, but the initial position is likely to read ‘off-centre’ of that. When you go into GPS mode in the air, that delta will be corrected, and at speed (unlike a car, or plane which have psychical constraints for just changing direction). Once corrected the system will feel ‘locked-in’ and normal. I’ve flown a lot with 2200mAh 3S Batteries. No issue whatsoever. Unless Vcc shows a drop below 4.5V in the log, its likely not to be the issue. My worst glitch i had was changing to Loiter from stab, and the flight path moved more that 25m. it was really alarming. Very fast and resulted in a crash. Randy has added extra code to detect location changes at quite that speed, but it can still occur."

Being “in a city” would actually be worse because there are lots of things to block signal or cause multi-path reflection.  If you are indoors, GPS reception will generally be poor.

This is also visible in the APM Planner interface in the attached screenshot. In the screenshot you can see that during the previous flight the quadcopter came from a south-west direction. In the current mission in waypoint [1] the quadcopter is supposed to fly straight up but insteed drifts away to the position indicated with the arrow.

Note that in mavproxy; when i set the quadcopter to auto; it always says “waypoint 1” so it looks the takeoff waypoint is always selecten when the mission starts. Another Note: The first mission after a restart work perfectly. So it looks like it has something to do with some values not being reset from a previous mission.

We are running stream mapping applications with both video and still images, so this would help smooth it all out…we get a little dizzy on some of the video. Can you set the yaw parameters separate in stabilize mode from auto mode?","So far this looks to be the only answer I have found in the documents from the Mission Command List under Condition-Yaw “Sec – not supported.  meant to limit the rotation speed (in deg/sec) as the vehicle turns to the desired heading” Hopefully being able to set the Yaw rate in deg/sec will be supported in the near future for auto mode.  This would be a very useful setting to manipulate for various applications. So far my APM 2.6 has worked flawlessly in all modes I have flown.  Autotune is something else to watch in action, especially when you flip the switch for the very first time after always flying manual for several years…leap of faith, but now a believer."

Make sure your motors are all spinning in the correct direction (as per the diagram) 4. Make sure you do all the PixHawk calibrations If you are testing on the ground, it could be that the PixHawk is raising motor RPM to those levels because the copter isn’t able to YAW.

215,"Low throttle in loiter takeoff, fast spinning rotors",1,"Hi, I am a developer and my graduation project (due next week  ) is to develop a autonomous quadcopter. I have based it on the APM2.6 and a beaglebone black with mavlink. To test the stability of the quadcopter platform I tried loiter mode today. I noticed some troubling behaviour in loiter mode. When I armed the APM2.6 in loiter mode and moved the throttle up slightly the motors started spinning fast. The throttle still was in the “go-down” part of the throttle in loiter mode. This behaviour does not occur after first putting the throttle into the center (1500pwm) and then all the way down till the rotors stop spinning. When I then put the throttle slightly up the rotors won’t spin until I move the throttle past the center. I expect that the latter behaviour is the correct one. So the rotors don’t spin until the throttle is above the center. Is this something I can fix or is it a bug in the arducopter code?","Whilst only fairly new to this myself your description confuses me. The ‘go down’ and start at high speed in particular, I’d expect your motors to start almost immediately at a low speed when you push the throttle forwards, by 50% the intent is to be at ‘hover’, higher than 50% climbs, lower than 50% which is not enough to sustain lift and it descends. I take it that you calibrated everything appropriately - transmitter, transmitter / RC to copter, ESC’s if they can be. Rotors not spinning until past 50% is not normal, I suspect that going back to basics by checking all cables & connections, calibration and tuning my reveal the cause. I had some issues on my setup with motors doing strange things and it was down to the APM (Pixhawk in my case) updating the ESC’s too often. My ESC’s have a published max refresh of 450Hz but the APM was updating at 490Hz, the symptom was motors stopping when they shouldn’t and going from 0 to max rpm with little to no provocation, it wasn’t predictable how or when they would. I also had issues of the motors not running / starting appropriately because the lowest value from the RC calibration process was 200 units below the start point of my ESC’s - the RC calibrated minimum throttle was 980, the ESC’s needed 1120, my ESC’s can not be calibrated so I had to modify what my transmitter was sending in addition to setting appropriate minimums on the throttle channel, these issues took me two or three days to fix."
216,Drift Mode Problem,1,"Hi Guys, I am having problems in  getting Drift mode to function properly. It has been going on for a few weeks now, in that time I have tried just about everything. I am using AC3.1-rc5, Mode 1 radio, latest MP, APM 2.5.2 In drift mode, I pitch forward and use the roll stick to turn, problem is , no matter how much roll I use my quad will only turn a few degrees left or right, as I have said, I have tried everything I can think of, re calibrate radio, compass, ACCL cal. I also have another quad with the same hardware, that one seems to fly great. (not sure if it has exactly the same firmware, it says 3.1, but doesn’t have the “rc5”  next to it, if this makes any difference. Can any one offer any possible solutions","I’m wondering about drift mode using a mode 1 radio.  According to the manual, drift mode only works with mode 2 (throttle left). Are you using drift with your mode 1 (throttle on right)?"
217,About to perform a maiden; motor duty cycle & navigation,1,"Hi, I’m a new multirotor user (but have had experience in fixed wing RC & UAVs) and have built my own quad which I intend to take on it’s maiden soon. To ensure that things go smoothly, I’ve been running ground tests to ensure that the vibration is fine, that the temperature predictions from eCalc were matching with real life, etc. However, one thing I’ve noticed and which I’m a bit confused / nervous about is stability and how it’s going to perform on it’s maiden. Specifically, when attempting to double-check whether I had the motors in the correct orientation / sequence, I had it set to loiter mode and (without propellers obviously) picked it up and tilted in various directions to see how the motors / gyro respond. Ultimately it was hard for me to tell much (it’s difficult to judge RPM visually and the motors are close enough that sound doesn’t help), so I checked the RC in / servo out readings, with no transmitter attached and with RC failsafe disabled (to allow for Mission Planner arming). What I found was that motors 3 and 4 (which in my configuration are the front left and rear right motors) had a relatively high output signal (roughly 60%), while motors 1 and 2 (front right and rear left) were only at something like 20%. Off the top of my head I can think of 3 potential causes:   That this is normal and part of the ArduCopter / Pixhawk control scheme; 2 opposite engines maintain hover thrust and counter each-other’s torque, the other 2 are kept low to permit a greater generation of net torque or directional thrust when required.   RC1-4 are not what I think they are (do not indicate the throttle for each motor)   The Pixhawk thinks it’s generating equal thrust on all engines, but that motors 1 and 2 do not require as much output signal (I have no idea why that would be however).   On a side note as well, I’d like to inquire as to how accurate I need to be with my accelerometer configuration; alone it’s not easy to use a tablet and hold my quad exactly on it’s side, nose, etc and so I’ve only been able to get it within a few degrees of properly level. Will this cause a consistent drift in flight, or is this something that will / should be mostly negated by the quad referencing it’s GPS location? I could always enlist the help of someone else to make this calibration more accurate, but if it’s unnecessary it’s not going to be worth the hassle. Regards, Josh","I wouldn’t recommend doing your initial setup testing in Loiter. I use Stabilize for that. Stabilize just works for self leveling, which is what you are testing for, Loiter throws in trying to hold a GPS position, so it could be causing your motors to do all sorts of unexpected stuff. I do what you are doing, but in Stabilize. I also put some strips of tape on the motor shafts to help visualize rotation. No props for this. Bring it up to about 1/3 throttle and put the pitch forward. Do the rear motors speed up? Good. Now pitch backward. Do the front motors now speed up? Good again. Now try right and left rolls. Do the appropriate right and left motors speed up. Good once again. If you want you can pick up the quad and see if the motors speed up to counteract your tilting it by hand. After it passes this test, I put the props on for an “almost hover” test. Still in Stabilize I bring up the motors so that it doesn’t quite lift off. By carefully pitching forward I should be able to lift only the rear end. I try the same thing in roll. This will show up if the frame configuration is correct (X or +). If it passes this you shouldn’t have any trouble popping it off the ground in any flight mode you’d like. Your leveling sounds OK. I’ve often had motors under no load conditions spin up more than I would have expected, but with props on they don’t do that."

It spin quite already at ground level, but not fast enough for maintain hover or slow enough to raise my alert on the prop adapter problem. Change the adapter and it fly well. Thanks for the support.

220,962100 Baud Connection,1,"Dear All, How are you guys? I am posting this topic since I have stuck with my project. Currently I am trying to get IMU messages at over 100Hz from Pixhawk. My connection between the pixhawk and an ARM based board computer is USB connection. MicroUSB port which is located at the side of the Pixhawk is the terminal port that I’ve used with. So far no luck. I successfully obtained 115200 baud rate connection and 25Hz data stream rate; however, I couldn’t change the baud rate to 962100 in order to increase data stream rate. SERIAL0_BAUD option in APM planner2 seems not working; besides, I changed all three SERIAL0/1/2_BAUD parameters to 962100, and it didn’t work either. In Mission Planner, it even does not have 962100 baud option in the list, it seems only supporting up to 115200. Any idea? If there’s Someone had over 100Hz IMU or any messages from Pixhawk, please share the experiences with me to get through this problem. Thank you in advance. Good day.","In the standard parameter section of APM planner(not mission planner), there’s the parameters for serial1/2, and you can change the baud rate there. Connection established with 921600!!! However, still I’ve not gotten over 100Hz IMU data. Pixhawk still emits 25Hz IMU data. I am looking into the arducopter source code now, when I fix the problem, I will let you guys know about that. Thanks."

If you want to get 100Hz IMU data stream from Pixhawk, you have to change ArduCopter.pde source file. In other words, you have to build sources and upload it to the Pixhawk. In the file, you can find the following line. { gcs_data_stream_send,  8,    950 }, 8 should mean 50Hz for PX4 board, but it actually emits data with 25Hz. So simply change the number 8 to 2, then you get 100Hz. { gcs_data_stream_send,  2,    950 }, I am not sure it is fundamental solution; however, it works for me. If you have any comment or possible reasoning, please let me know. I will close this posting as solved tho."
221,GSC FS Doesn't Engage,1,"I’m currently using a Pixhawk with ArduCopter v3.1.5. For my ground station, I’m using an Android tablet with DroidPlanner. I also have a Spektrum transmitter for arming and manual control. My GPS/Mag is 3DR and my ground station telemetry link is 3DR 915 MHz. The problem I’m sunning into occurs when trying to test the GSC failsafe. My GPS and battery failsafes are working correctly. I have the throttle failsafe set to ‘Continue with Mission in Auto Mode’, and that seems to be working correctly.

Has anyone else had issues with the GSC failsafe? Could this issue be because I have all other failsafes enabled? Thanks!","Although no one has posted a response, I thought I would update those of you that may be somewhat following this thread. From my troubleshooting, it seems like the throttle failsafe is active whenever I use the transmitter to arm and initiate the auto mode; however, if I use the GSC to arm and initiate auto mode, then the GSC failsafe works. I have not figured out a way to make the two work in conjunction. Does anyone know if they were designed to work separate from each other, or are they supposed to be able to work in conjunction.

221,GSC FS Doesn't Engage,2,"I’m currently using a Pixhawk with ArduCopter v3.1.5. For my ground station, I’m using an Android tablet with DroidPlanner. I also have a Spektrum transmitter for arming and manual control. My GPS/Mag is 3DR and my ground station telemetry link is 3DR 915 MHz. The problem I’m sunning into occurs when trying to test the GSC failsafe. My GPS and battery failsafes are working correctly. I have the throttle failsafe set to ‘Continue with Mission in Auto Mode’, and that seems to be working correctly.

223,How to stop entering LAND?,1,"Hi there.  Running 3.1.5 on a 3DR X8 with Pixhawk. Even though I have the battery failsafe disabled, when the battery gets low FAILSAFE comes up on the mission planner screen, the buzzer starts going off, and the copter automatically enters LAND mode.  This is not desirable behavior.  I rely on a * attached directly to the lipo’s balance plug, which I trust much more than the 3DR power module.  Once that beeps, I know I have around a minute to land.  I don’t need the copter to enter land mode automatically, potentially over an unsuitable landing site. So how do I stop this behavior?  I already have the battery failsafe disabled.  Thanks!",please post a .log from such situation.
224,Mission planner,1,"Hi, I’ve been using mission planner on my tri-copter for a few months. Many times she flys to some waypoints and then RTL’s. In other words she doesn’t fly to all the waypoints loaded in the mission. I’ve tried adding more waypoints closer together, using less waypoints and reduced the expected flight distance of the mission. Nothing has worked to date. Also, I’m using a new battery and there has been plenty of charge after the each mission that skipped waypoints. There’s no pattern to the amount of waypoints she flys to before RTL . Sometimes she  makes it through 3 waypoints sometimes more. Thanks for any thoughts you can share on this subject.

When I land in stabilize, my motors are still spinning.  It takes 3-4 seconds to shut the motors down with my throttle down and left. Are you saying that once I zero’d the throttle I can’t restart the motors?  It seems to me when I land, which is sometimes alt hold and sometimes stabilize mode, I have to throttle down, but the motors are still spinning, I then, with throttled 0’d, have to push it to lower left for 2-3 seconds to shut them completely off.    If I landed and throttled down to 0, then decided to take off again, is it not possible to accelerate the motors and take off again in stabilize mode?  If this is the case, why don’t the motors just quit spinning at 0 without have to take throttle to lower left? Thanks for your help…     I’m not happy it was operator error or maybe setup error, but somewhat relieved to know it wasn’t a FC or hardware problem.

There is one scenario that may stop them from starting during a stop midair:  a stable vertical fall, it can spin the propellers bacwards , once that happens, ESC will have trouble to get in sync… What you describe takes 2-3 sec is disarming, yes, that takes time - and no, you did not disarm.  - so the motors would still spin up if you increased throttle.  unless you configure MOT_SPIN_ARMED parameter, throttle stick all the way down in stabilize does stop motors.

For me Loiter mode would travel more at an angle than straight. Fix:   mount GPS/Mag higher above the frames to get it away from all the interference. Mine is about 4 inches above the top frame.

The reason I even bothered to do the cal’s was because in “Loiter Mode” the copter would not actually loiter. It would wobble and drift around a lot. Versus “Stable Mode”, where it could be held quite steady if there was no wind. Prior, I had used successfully the Loiter mode, and RTL mode. Both worked just fine, except for the wobble/drift in Loiter. The RTL seemed to work quite well. Yesterday after performing the calibrations I flew the copter in my backyard, my normal flying site so far. I took off in Stable mode and it flew nicely as before. I then switched on Loiter mode and it very swiftly started to fly backwards and disappeared from my view when it went over the roof of my house. I switched into RTL and I do not know of it actually attempted to RTL but it did not return. I heard loud buzzing noise and spotted the copter in one of my trees merrily chopping up the leaves. I was in a bit of a panic but then remembered to switch back to Zero and the buzzing stopped as I ran to the front of my house. By then the copter was on the roof and I was able to recover it. Amazingly it only suffered a broken landing skid. Getting back up on the horse, so to speak, I then flew it again in Stable mode which was successful. But I am now afraid to try Loiter Mode until I sort the issue out. I read the tutorial on downloading logs in Mission Planner and I was able to save three logs, which was everything in the onboard memory. They are huge, 2.7MB each. Could that be right? Anyway, I tried looking through them and tried to figure out how to use the graphs, analyzers, etc but it’s currently WAY over my pay grade! I suppose a simple question would be, is it possible I goofed up the compass calibration procedure? Should I perform it again? Does it matter that I was inside my home when I did it? Does it actually require being outside Like I saw in one video with the gent spinning around with his quad? I mostly fly it in Stable Mode, but I would like to be able to use a nice and steady Loiter Mode from time to time. Well, thank you if you have read all the way through this enormous post. ",Thank you for the reply!  No! I did not check E-W-S. I only checked N.   I shall check the other compass settings now. I waited about 1-2 minutes for the GPS fix.

","The log you posted isn’t very helpful. Based upon the altitude it was recording, this log was only recorded the period after you crashed. To make matters worse, all your tuning and setup parameters are missing. It looks like they were truncated off the front end. There’s no indication of a RTL command being issued in this log. You might try posting the log just prior to this. I’m not sure why there should be three logs as most arm-disarm sequences generate a single log file."

","I’m not sure of the exact timing between lines but there are ways to get an idea. There is a newer “Time” field that gives you an interval. However I think that’s based off a time entry in the GPS row. That’s a time value in milliseconds, 1/1000 of a second. So if you want to know the time difference between two lines, look for the nearest GPS item values, subtract them and divide by 1000. Were it me, I’d erase the whole thing and reinstatement the firmware fresh. If you save your parameters before doing so you can just reload it after the firmware reinstall. But not knowing exactly what is happening, it’s hard to say if a firmware reinstall would solve your problem,"

Searching the internet does not bring much answers. What is wrong?",Ok 2 things I can think of. Do you have it set for the correct frame. + or X. If you have that set correct then recheck your motor leads to the apm.
231,"APM2.5-APM2.7 roll and pitch behave in a strange, wrong way",5,"I recently build a quadcopter using an APM 2.5 flashed with mission planner (MAC-version), using a Futaba 10C with an FrySky 8CH receiver (no SBUS). When I tried to fly it, roll and aileron behaved wrong, in a kind of inverted way, this although radiosetup showed correct controler movements. Throttle and yaw work ok.

232,Questions about Stabilize and Compass,1,"Hello, I have some questions that I didn’t found on documentation or in the forum:   In the stabilize mode, the compass is used ? Is compass used on all modes ?   Some people say that you can plug the battery to the ESCs and then use the BEC to power the APM while the APM is plugged on the USB, is that correct and it is possible ? I heard someone saying that it fried the APM. If this is possible, the JP1 jumper must removed or inserted ?   My first flight was a disaster, the quadcopter (X) took off and then it started to fly towards some directions and it was very hard to control, could this be caused by interference on the compass ? Could this be caused by the unbalanced propellers ? I already checked that the motors are spinning right and also that it tries to stabilize when I hold it with my hands.   Is any GPS instrumentation used in Stabilize mode ?   In Stabilize mode, if I just level up the throttle it is supposed to stabilize it self and keep stable hovering ?   Thank you !"," I believe so, yes.  Even in stabilize it helps with yaw. Why would you want to do that?  If APM is plugged into USB, it is powered by USB. Hard to say.  If you post a log, we might see something.  Was it windy? Maybe.  If you have geofence enabled, it will use that.  Failsafes that go to RTL will need it.  You may have a pre-arm check that needs GPS.  You really should not fly without good GPS (unless indoors, of course) Stabilize in APM is not the same as Stabilize on a DJI.  In APM it keeps the vehicle axes steady, wind will still push it around.  Loiter is more like the DJI “stabilize”. "

234,Can't Run Compassmot via CLI or Mission Planner,1,"My setup: TBS Disco with a Pixhawk 3DR GPS/compass combo 3DR Power Module running a 4S system V1 3DR Air telemetry module connected to Telem1 Teensy 3.1 connected to Telem2 going to FrSky X8R for telemetry to Taranis Running DJI 920kV motors and 30A OPTO ESCs Pixhawk is running 3.1.5 Mission Planner is 1.3.7 I followed the compassmot instructions in the manual and connected the battery after I turned on the transmitter, then connected via USB to the laptop.

235,Random extreme uncommanded pitch and roll in stabilize help,1,"Well, I took my F800 Hex for its second run today for some tuning.

I want some second opinions. What do you all think happened? Attached is the log file THANK YOU ALL!","It’s hard to tell if you had a motor/ESC failure without the motor logging on. I agree the video makes it appear you had an ESC problem. It could be, but I’m not so sure. If you look at the attached plot of your throttle in and out against your BaroAlt there’s something odd. The log says your throttle input (i.e., you) was headed to zero even before your octo started dropping. And your Pixhawk obediently gave you what it thought you were asking for. If your RC Tx had completely crapped out I’d expect to see a failsafe ERR, but there isn’t one. Perhaps you saw the octo rocking a bit (it had reached about a 10 degree departure at that point) and chopped the throttle to save it? Anyway, put new props on it, tie it to the ground and run it at high power until you are satisfied it either is or isn’t an ESC problem."

238,Throttle oscillation / pulsing motors in loiter,1,"Hi, My hexacopter hovers at about 25% throttle in stabilize. When I switch to loiter, I can hear the motors pulsing. My thoughts are that this is an oscillation and that the throttle increase is causing the copter to overshoot the desired altitude. If this a likely reason? and if so, is there a PID that can be adjusted for throttle or ALT-HOLD that can adjusted to reduce the correction. Thanks Jamie","*, Providing tlogs and/or data flash logs will greatly improve the chances of identifying and resolving your issue. Regards, TCIII GM"

240,Failing motor or ESC?,1,"I recently built my new hexacopter with the APM controller harware/software and so far I love it so much more than my Aeroquad, multi-wii, or KK2.1 controllers!  I seem to have a motor/esc problem though that causes one of the motor/esc combos (motor *) to fail (I’m guessing over heating).  This causes the hexacopter to roll to it’s right and head towards the ground.  Fortunately this only happens near the end of the battery (8-9 min) or midway through the 2nd battery if I don’t give it time to cool down.  I’ve attached the log file, but you can see just before the 4 minute mark that the throttle to Motor1 starts to increase and become unstable.  Motor2 likewise decreases and tries to compensate, but if I left it in the air any longer the throttle would have eventually maxed on motor1 and the copter would have rolled itsenf into the ground.  Does this look more like a motor or ESC failure? Another questions I have is why the motors and esc’s seem so hot after running.  My hexacopter is a ~3ft home built wooden frame that weighs about 2.1kg with battery and all.  My motors are rated to max thrust of 860g at 20A and I have 30 amp ESC’s.  If you do the math you see that the each of the 6 motors should only have to put out 350g for lift (40% thrust).  After 8 min I seem to use ~4500mah of the 5400mah in the battery, which I believe means I’m drawing about 33.75 amps (4500 * 60/8).  This is only 5.625 amps per motor/esc so they shouldn’t be hot at all. Any insight about the heating or motor/esc failure would be appreciated.  Thanks Kirk","Your assessment of a problem with ESC or motor looks dead on. I’d recommend a “finger test” also. After flying, if only for a short time, put a finger on the ESC and * motor and compare the temperatures to your other ESCs/motors. Electrically speaking, motors are extremely simple, especially compared to an ESC. Motors tend to fail mechanically, like from bad bearings or damaged magnets. And often that can be sensed by twirling the motor with your finger. See if there’s any binding or roughness in motor 1. My bet would be a flaky ESC as they are more complex than motors. It could be some sort of heat issue causing it to cut back after you’ve been flying a while. If your amperage estimates are correct you really shouldn’t be seeing a lot of heating of motors. It could be that your ESC timings as set in such a manner as to cause the heating. For example high ESC timing will give more power but may cause motor heating. It’s less efficient on high. Also the ESCs PWM timing for controlling the motor can cause ESC heating if it’s running a very high PWM rate."

241,"To failsafe or not to failsafe, that is the question",1,"Hi A question that might be important when flying for real: My Hexa has a PixHawk running APM 3.1.5 and it’s running with 3DR Power Module with a 4S - 5800 mAh battery. Today I was outside testing some new programming on my radio and had the Hexa without propellers. I connected a fully charged battery and armed the copter and was using several flight modes with Throttle above 80%. As the hexa was without props I could do my radio programming without fear of “unwanted” reactions. As I was programming the radio I decided to wait for a battery failsafe to occur that is set at 14V and behavior is set to RTL. The Failsafe did occur and the mode changed (I was looking for that using APM Planner 2.0.11) but the motors kept spinning happily and the low battery beeping was on, and although the hexa was always on the ground nothing occurred… When the voltage dropped below 13V I decided to manually switch the mode to stabilize and disarm the hexa. Wasn’t it supposed to stop spinning the motors or even reduce their speed to the speed they have when armed?? What is the expected behavior in this situation?? The worst is yet to come. I decided to rearm the hexa, and although the Voltage was at 13V - which is below the Failsafe - it armed and allowed throttle and flight mode changes like nothing was wrong, not even a miserable beeping of low battery. I’ve waited a few minutes but no Failsafe occurred and I’m sure that it would happily continue until the batteries were completely damaged… What’s up with this??? Besides the possibility of damaging the batteries if it would be flying I imagine when or where it would fall without warning.",I’m adding the log

245,Do I have to re-setup if I upgrade to 3.1 firmware?,1,"First post, so please be kind! I’ve had a look on the wiki and the manual and search on here and although there are some cryptic references I cannot put my mind at ease. I have a 450 quad which flies well with APM 2.5 and firmware 2.9.1 and I’m thinking of upgrading to 3.1. With the loss of position hold and all the new features I am wondering if I do the upgrade if I have to set the quad up again from scratch as a fresh install, or do I have to save my existing param to a file and then reload them after the upgrade, or do I not have to do anything? I know that with Pos hold no longer there I will have to re-set up flight modes.  (BTW - On that point, position hold still shows in the manual, so is its deletion simply temporary?) I would be grateful for any pointers. Thanks a lot","Hello, I have the same question for an upgrade from 3.1x to 3.1.y Someone knows that ?"

It costs you overall thrust though, since one set of motors limits the others.  But at a certain misalignment (or greater), it can’t fight the yaw rotation. Here’s what I found:   If there’s more than about 250-300 msec difference between the motors (in terms of RCOUT pulse width), the default PID settings can’t stop a net yaw rotation.   If you align the motors to get within 100-150 msec difference in pulse width, the default PID settings work.   If you align the motors to get within about 50 msec difference in pulse width, you basically have full power.   Someone should get clever and write a log analyzer that looks at Loiter performance and recommends tweaks to individual motors in terms of rotation on the boom.  It wouldn’t be hard to do."

You can eyeball them and even cheat with a level and the best I’ve been able to manage is about 50 msec between the CCW and CW motors.  It’s surprisingly difficult. For example, if you see one motor that’s cock-eyed, it’s easy to fix.  but if you have something systemic (i.e. 3 or more motors that are imperceptibly off), it gets really difficult.  It’s hard to see 1 or 2 degrees spread across four motors, but those errors add-up to a serious misalignment. When everything is really tuned well, the average difference between CCW and CW motors may only be 50 msec.  But even within the CCW or CW group, there may be a 10-20 msec difference between them.  What would be really nice is a log analyzer that says: Average Diff Between CCW and CW Motors:  250 msec Recommendation:  Rotate CCW motors CW or rotate CW motors CCW on booms Order of Significance:  CCW – Motor 1 is largest offender, followed by 2, 7 and 8 Order of Significance: CW – Motor 5 is largest offender, followed by 6 and 4 It wouldn’t be able to give absolute recommendations, since it wouldn’t know the individual motor thrust or the boom length.  But it would be great to have a hit list of which motor to tweak and which direction to tweak it.  My adjustments were as subtle as 2 layers of black electrical tape placed on the side of the motor mount.  After compressing with screws, we’re talking a fraction of a millimeter at best."

Then the mounting clamps could have a corresponding scale laser-marked on them so individual adjustments could be dialed-in. Slight misalignment can have a pretty devastating impact on performance because it caps the output to the lesser of the CW and CCW motors.  So if the maximum pulse is 1950msec but there’s a 200msec differential between CW and CCW motors, your true maximum output is 1750msec."

The length of time  the pulse is high is changed between about 1ms and 2ms. 1ms is zero throttle. A perfectly set up multi copter should ideally have all pulse lengths the same for dead level flight. If something is off like weight or alignment or a weak motor etc the autopilot will have to correct for this and the demands to each esc will be different.

The high pulse is supposed to to vary between one and two milliseconds (or 1000 to 2000 microseconds).  In a perfect world, 1000 usec is zero throttle and 2000 usec is full throttle. What I was observing was a systematic variation between the average pulse widths of the CW and CCW motors.  Even the most meticulously designed vehicle will have slight differences, but in this case mine were clearly too large. Put your own vehicle in loiter and just let it stay in one place for several minutes.  Then plot all four, six or eight of the RCOUT channels.  You’ll see just how much your motors have to compensate for vehicle imbalance, drift, misalignment, etc. etc."

252,Ground speed VS altitude in auto mode Dangerous behaviour,6,"Hi everybody, I am optimizing the auto mode on my multicopters, for this I am trying different navigation speed.

At some point (speed) it starts to lose altitude and will certainly crash if I don’t back down on the throttle. I would like to test this problem in auto mode but I am having problems changing the speed. I would also love to be able to change the speed on command. In Mission Planner under the ‘Actions’ Tab there is a Change Speed button with a text box before it displaying the number 100. Changing that number - even drastically- has no effect on my speed. The Do_change_speed command during waypoint navigation causes the drone to simply stop dead in the sky and won’t go to any waypoints or perform an RTL unless I land and restart the APM2.6 - disconnect/reconnect battery. I have asked around on the forum regarding the speed control issue and no one knows. So my question is - how do you guys change your speed? Can you do it without changing the default WPNAV_SPEED parameter? I am using firmware version 3.1.5 - APM 2.6 Y6 Thanx

That’s why you have to setup the different fail safe options in the PIXHAWK by using MP. Here you can define a specific value for your throttle, usually lower then 1000 to activate a transmitter or receiver fail safe. You can then specify if the drone should RTL, or land, I case this fail will happen during flight. You can do similar things with power levels, to RTL or Land on Fence Breach, very useful if you lose control and the drone is either climbing above a specific limit, or moving away in a uncontrolled manner… And they all work like a champ !"

267,Barometer pressure glitches with PX4,1,"Some important stuff first:  I’m using the PX4FMU+IO, not the Pixhawk I’m currently running with git master to get logging to work, but the problem also occurs on 3.1.5, so I’m posting about it here. The problem can be replicated in a benchtop setting without the motors running. It happens with at least 2 different PX4FMU+IO stacks, so I don’t think it is a hardware issue.  Hi, I’m trying to get the Arducopter firmware working on the PX4FMU/IO board stack.  I’m having some issues with invalid altitude measurements.  Typically the altitude will go to 0.0 or NaN and stay there after flying for a while.  Sometimes it will go to large (20,000m+) positive or negative values first. First, I tried running release 3.1.5, installed with the firmware upgrader.  On my first tests, the altitude measurements would drop to 0.0 after a while and the quadcopter would shoot up in the air if it was in altitude hold mode. Unfortunately, logging to the PX4’s SD card did not seem to work with this version, so I built the latest git master version (773bc7bcbe06363535dd0326c264fb114362f553) of ArduCopter and have continued testing with that.  Logs work with it, but it still has the altitude measurement issue. In the logs this seems to concide with the pressure measurement from the barometer momentarily dropping to 0.  Often, the barometer temperature measurement will also read some incorrect value (>400C) at the same time.  Both pressure and temperature measurements recover after a short time (sometimes a single line in the log) but the altitude measurement stays at 0.0. I’ve had this problem occur on two different PX4FMU+IO stacks, so I don’t think it is a hardware issue.  Just to be sure, I captured I2C bus #2 traffic from power on until the altitude got stuck at 0.0 in a benchtop setup and decoded/plotted all the barometer measurements.  The only strange thing I see is that the MS5611 sometimes seems to return a 4th byte when reading the ADC.  I’m not too familiar with the sensor, so that may be a feature I just haven’t read about yet.  Other than that, the measurements look good and I don’t see any sudden jumps or drops to 0. My test procedure was as follows:  Power on RC transmitter Power on the PX4 by connecting it to my computer via. USB Connect over USB with APM Planner 2.0 Arm PX4IO board with safety switch Arm using CSC Throttle up to 50% Switch to alt-hold mode Relative altitude wanders around 0.0 on GCS Eventually, altitude drops to 0.0 and stays there.  Lifting or moving the PX4 does not change altitude measurement (attitude measurements still update correctly).  Since that was a stationary benchtop setup with only the PX4 powered, vibration is unlikely to be part of the problem. I’ve also attached a log from an actual outdoor flight where this problem occurred.  I was using Droidplanner 2 for telemetry.  It glitched one time but recovered, and glitched a second time where I got a NaN altitude on Droidplanner.  At that point putting it into alt-hold mode would of course cause it to ascend uncontrollably.","I modified the startup file to put nsh on /dev/ttyACM0. I then did another benchtop test, waited for the altitude to get stuck at 0 and ran the ms5611 program in nsh: * Meanwhile, ArduCopter shows a 0 altitude. So the ms5611 driver seems to be working correctly after the program occurs although the error counters are greater than zero.  Usually I see some errors during normal operation and it doesn’t seem to always be a problem.  I’m not sure what message is published by ms5611 when it has an error.  Would a single bad reading on the barometer cause ArduCopter’s altitude measurement to get stuck at 0?"

269,4 Inch cut in Forearm: Pilot Error or Possible Failsafe BUG?,1,"Hi, I am running AC3.1.5 on a 450 size quad and have had quite a good experience until now. Here is what happened. I took the quad to my other apartment for the first time which is on the 3rd floor. Tried to arm it on the balcony but it would not arm as the GPS pre-Arm check was failing. Since I was not planning to use any GPS related features and would be flying indoors, I disabled the GPS pre-arm check in MP. Copter Armed took off hovered for a few seconds and then al hell broke loose. The quad came directly towards me. Moving the sticks had no effect on the quad and it was pretty close so I had no choice but to stick my hand out and stop it.One of the props hit my forehand and broke leaving me with a deep gash in my forearm. [attachment=0]OUCH_opt.jpg[/attachment] Since I still had the TX in my other hand i killed the throttle but no luck because by then it was already in RTL (Failsafe kicked in)and heading to some incorrect location that it thought was HOME. Looking at the logs both the GPS & the Geofence Failsafes kicked in together. It was a false Geofence failsafe because of the incorrect GPS location it registered and a completely incorrect home location too. Actual Home was about 30mts Off. Logs are attached below however a few points I noted:   If I skipped the GPS Pre-Arm - Shouldn’t all functionality GPS (especially fail safes) be disabled?   The GPS Failsafe kicked in first.My GPS failsafe is set to LAND. However the GeoFence Kicked in also and caused RTL failsafe to activate. Now if the GPS failsafe has kicked in and subsequently the GeoFence failsafe has kicked in then why did the GeoFence RTL take priority? The RTL would be useless without a GPS lock. In this case shouldnt the GPS Failsafe have overridden the GeoFence Failsafe? Also, I never noticed the LAND command that I have set for GPS failsafe. It directly went to RTL.   When RTL Kicked in, the Quad came straight at me. I have the RTL height set at 80mts. Shouldnt the quad have gone up before moving towards what it believed was home. Could this be cause I armed from the third floor.   So coming to my question - Is this the expected behaviour or is there a bug in there that needs fixing? What I wanted to do was fly indoors without any GPS functionality. What is the checklist I should have followed to ensure the indoor flight was safe without interference from the GPS? Attached are both the telemetry & dataflash logs. Please note that I take off only towards the end of the logs. at about the 75-80% progress of the logs. There are a couple of ARMS’ DISARMS but please look at the last ARM which is when I actually take-off. Any help - Guidance would be grateful.","For reference, this issue has been discussed over here *"

Turnigy 9XR Pro Transmitter Ublox LEA-6H GPS 3DR power APM 2.5.2 4 x NTM 28 series 1000KV motors. Battery 4S. There are no apparent issues with the receiver communicating with the APM and it is properly connected. The transmitter has been calibrated in Mission Planner. I think I have partially resolved this issue.  It seems to be related to the stock firmware in the ESCs.  The two beeps at start up mean that the brake is off.   I also figured out by RTFM (reading the manual) that when entering “calibration” mode, with these ESCs it is a menu system; whereby you can change whether the brake is on or off, the battery type and timing.  Using this I have set this to Brake off, Battery LiXX and Timing Auto. I was considering flashing these MultiStar 30A ESCs with the SimonK firmware.   However, I read about a number of cases of issues with recent purchases of this ESC after changing to SimonK firmware.   Apparently the ESC gets very hot, very quickly; to the point that it raises concern of failure. If someone can advise me please on my findings then I would be grateful. Thanks and regards."

271,Spline WayPoints in 3.1.5,1,I just upgraded to 3.1.5 and I have a mission plan that I have used over and over again. After trying this mission I noticed that it was not flying straight from each way point.  I checked the mission plan and spline was not checked. In the logs how do I see if spline is on?,"I’m not sure 3.1.5 supports spline, I think its is in the newer beta 3.2 versions."

I am reading the instructions, and it says simple mode is only available for stabilize, sport, drift, and land modes.  Is that still correct?  I’d like to use loiter for photography, and I think it would be easier to pan and what not in loiter if it was in super simple mode.  Is this something that is possible? Thanks!","super simple won’t change panning for photos. Please don’t take this the wrong way . I would highly recommend learning to fly without these crutches, you won’t learn to get out of trouble relying on simple modes.relying on the gps modes is bad enough, you should be able to fly in stabilise fairly confindently before you put much distance between you and the copter. I appreciate at distance orientation is easily lost at range, but please learn the basics. you will enjoy flying a lot more, you don’t want to lose your copter or camera gear if you can help it."

Thanks!","Another perspective: I had to follow a different path (order) to learn how to fly. After I kept easily crashing my quad in stabilize mode simply because I had to master too many simultaneous hand, eye, orientation, movements (I had never flown before), I used simple mode to eliminate one of the flying variables (orientation) so I could concentrate on the others. I just had too many cases of my yaw changing which had the quad going left/back when I was wanting right/forward. After achieving basic proficiency in simple mode, I was able to turn it off to introduce the nose-heading (yaw) component and become proficient at that (still working on it!). Given simple mode doesn’t use the GPS, it was very reliable. I don’t know how reliable it would be indoors near metal objects which may interfere with the compass. Note I also had to buy and practice (a lot) with a micro quad to get the basic feel. This saved me many hundreds of dollars in crash repair of my large quad! Tim"

You have a good point about it not being gps based necessarily though. Very good point on practicing on something smaller. I practice and play with an ecks 310mm frame quad with a cheap kk flight controller…its had a few crashes, and no major issues…brilliant for orientation practice and for building muscle memory and hand eye coordination. Learnt more flying that for a few weeks that intimidating bigger multis.

273,"Apm 2.5, 3.1.5 AutoTrim Problem",1,"Hİ All, I used to fly with my V frame qudcopter for a while, but yesterday without changing anything, during the take of quad, moved fastly to forward and i was landed witout any crash but after this point unable to take off stabilised again. Issue is I am arming the quad, and try to take of but it is aimed to go forward, i manualy give backwards pitch and keep quad in hower by manually giving negative pitch all the time. After i decided to Auto trim and trim the quad in air. After doing this, quad is howering OK but in the mission planner i am observing that quad is staying at -10deg pitch although it is paralled to the ground. I have downgrade to many firmwares and upgrade it again to 3.15 but nothing changed. I have checked frame escs, radio props etc. everything is okay but problem is still ongoing. I have uploaded logs and graphs for my couple minutes of hower please have a look at, Regards.","I would re-calibrate the accelerometer, it looks like the apm/copter was not perfectly level when you initially calibrated.  Refer here (*) for instructions.  “The level position is the most important to get right as this will be the attitude that your controller considers level while flying.”   I think AutoTrim is more for fine tuning (small adjustments) while flying."

The mission would not read correctly from APM, it appeared to read but then I got a blank screen.

There must be a limit but I certainly can’t find it in the Wikki or anywhere else.  If you hit that limit does it actually corrupt the EEPROM or just not upload the mission?

275,Speed Limits in APM?

If you put a number higher than the copter is capable of achieving than it just goes that speed it’s able to.  The slider in MP goes to a certain value but you can put any value in the Full Param List and the Copter code will accept it and attempt it. This can be verified here:  *

284,3DR Y6 DIY RTL malfunction?,1,"RTL has worked fine for 10-15 flights. Tonight I performed compassmot test; 6% & 7% Did a test flight in back yard, alt-h drifted to back about 100 ft, switched RTL, all seemed well until it began its descent, then did slow toilet bowl down and “gently” crashed only breaking a prop. What happened? I’m not too confident now to put it back up in the air. Thanks for help. P.S. I just noticed one of the nuts were off on the tail holding the FC base plate down; it does flex quite easily. The tail does move a bit now as well.  I Loctite all steel fasteners, but it is possible that one was missed. Could that have possibly caused enough vibration to confuse the FC and GPS/compass? See attached photo.",Hi I would be most interested to hear what went wrong because I had a similar problem yesterday afternoon - coincidence?   The GPS HDOP was at 2.1 which is quite normal for around here certain parts of the day. I tried to do an auto mission. Auto takeoff was fine and then suddenly halfway to first waypoint my Y6(B) got stuck in mid air. Auto would not continue and RTL does nothing. Tried to switch between auto and RTL several times. No response even though GPS reports 3D lock. Slight twitch when I switched to loiter and was able to fly home and land in loiter mode. The machine loiters fine. I disconnected and reconnected the batteries and did a manual takeoff. Moved some distance away from me and put into loiter. All fine then switched to RTL. Nothing happens as if still in loiter. Telemetry reports RTL mode engaged so I know that works. I did not manage to get RTL to work again before I ran out of time and batteries. Would HDOP of 2.1 with 8 satellites and 3d lock result in no Auto or RTL function? Alt hold also worked fine btw.

I have no clue what I could do more…  Thank you!","I spend again a lot of time in analysing this misbehaviour. I contacted also the helpdesk of 3DR and they are really helpful. But unfortunately they didn’t locate my problem. In my despair I reset the PH by installing the Arduplane and then the Arducopter Firmware again. This didn’t solve my problem but enabled the logging of RCIN an RCOUT what revealed the following log information: In this diagram you can see the twitching on the Roll-axis which correlates to movement shown in the video. Additionally you can see the RCIN of channel 1. I realised that every time I got a twitch the RCIN on all RC channels goes down to zero and immediately back to its idle PWM rate and the copter follow this input. This diagram shows a closer extract of just one twitch: To be sure that this input occurs also on RCOUT I compared these two signals. It’s clearly visible that the PH put through the “wrong” input (caused by vibrations) auf the RX to the ESC’s what trig-gers that misbehaviour. So far so good, I exchanged the S.Bus cable in the field and hoped it’s the culprit. But I have had no luck and the misbehaviour still remains… I have to connect my oscilloscope at home and try to replicate the flight vibrations to localize the faulty connection. Possible reasons:  Connection RX and PH Futaba Receiver Pixhawk RX connection port for S.Bus or any other hardware issue  Had anyone similar problems how can share his experiences with me to solve my problem?"

I have no clue what I could do more…  Thank you!",The problem is solved! The reason was the mode of the Futaba R6308SBT receiver. This receiver offers two modes: “normal” and “high-speed” (default is “normal”). As soon I changed the mode to “high-speed” (& telemetry off) the response time of the RC inputs was much more precise and the negative peaks to 0 were gone and therefore also the twitching problem. I assume the problem is a sampling mismatch between the Futaba “normal” mode and the PH. Here the manual to switch the mode:  I assume this could help also with other Futaba receivers which are not well supported.

""Warning to FRSky receiver users and users of other receivers that modify channel 5 during a failsafe event Some FRSky tx/rx systems receivers can only be set-up to modify all channels including the flight mode channel (channel 5) when a failsafe event occurs.  For these receivers it is important to setup the receiver’s channel 5 failsafe value so that the APM is switched into RTL, Loiter or LAND.  This is critical because there is a very short period of time (3/50ths of a second) between when the receiver pulls the throttle low and when the APM initiates the RTL or LAND.  During this time, if the receiver also switches the flight mode channel to stabilize or acro the APM may switch to stabilize momentarily and then because the copter is in stabilize with throttle at zero it will disarm the copter (i.e. Test #2).""

Considering the IRIS ships with a D4R-II and is one of the quads I fly, I wondered what is the best course of action given what’s in the manual. I am able to set the failsafe for each channel on those receivers I listed so I assume that probably doesn’t apply for my case but it is a bit confusing and may be better to specify which receivers or line of receivers (e.g., V, D, X series) this note is for. Any clarification about it would be great so I can remove that failsafe setting for the mode switch. Thanks!"
288,Proper Radio Failsafe Settings,9,"I’m getting my plane and quads finally set again and have a question regarding the radio failsafe. When I do the normal failsafe setting in Mission Planner, I have my throttle go to the right pulsewidth value and that works just fine an d the mode shows it going into RTL like I set. Should I also have my receiver failsafe set such that my mode switch also goes to RTL? It seems like it’s redundant and maybe not necessary but since I’m setting everything up on my vehicles right now, I might as well be consistent with all of them. Thanks!",We should change that text to be clearer. This is correct: “Some FRSky tx/rx systems receivers can only be set-up to modify all channels including the flight mode channel (channel 5) when a failsafe event occurs.” But the FrSky D4R-II that ship with the Iris and the RTF units are programmed to NOT modify CH5.

I assume the X series does not because I can set each channel individually from my radio and I see that each goes to their respective positions just fine. Does that mean that other D series or V series receivers are problematic instead? That generic blanket statement (aside from a video for one specific receiver on the IRIS) makes someone cautious like me set all my receivers to have the receiver failsafe so the throttle goes low to trigger RTL but also set my Mode to RTL, which is wrong. A little more clarification for the future would be helpful for anyone else that comes across it."

289,Troubleshooting Flight Controls New Build,1,"I just finished my first Quad. Ardupilot 2.6 610 KV motors 12x4.5 Hobby King Slow flight Props. My issue is the quad has a slow (about 1-2 CPS) oscillation. It will fly level, but hunts to maintain it. The oscillation rate is stable. It is excited by application of power, and dampens as power is reduced. If this was the tail on a heli, I would assume the gain on the gyros was too high. I tried adjusting some of the gains in AMP planner, but it did not seem to have any effect. Where to start? Is there a trick to get the values to transfer to the autopilot? The only other issue might be the props…they are pretty flexible. Thanks, Dave",[infocopter][/infocopter]

I am running the latest 3.1.x Tricopter release, and I cannot find RSSI_RANGE in Full Parameters List in Mission Planner, only RSSI_PIN. Is this is similar issue with the Tricopter version build? Best Regards, /Roger","@ Tringe, unfortunatelly the RSSI_RANGE parameter is missing in the apm copter 3.1.5 and 3.1.4 and 3.1.3 didn’t check earlier version. could you check what is wrong there, also, on apm2.6 what would be the best RSSI_PIN number to use.  Thank you!"

302,ALT HOLD LOITER Throttle problems,1,"Hello All, this question maybe MOOT by the time Firmware 3.2 is released (because as i understand it, taking off in ALT HOLD & LOITER will be the same as Taking Off in Stabilize) but i will ask anyway. I am Currently having a throttle problem in ALT HOLD and LOITER. In Stabilize, My THR_MID is 400, i think the Log Shows that to be true, thats what it was yesterday any way. I am trying to increase my ALT HOLD PID and LOITER PID because in my Mind that may stop the Descending behavior even though my Throttle is at 50% when it happens. The Quad has been Auto Tuned. what i hear from the motors sounds like a REVVING sound as it tries to maintain altitude. Attached is my Log, Am i on the Right track here? Thanks in Advance","your vibrations seem normal but I think they are too high, and this could be the reason for this behavior. the inertial simply does not work well. * Do you hear motors pulsing when switch to althold - loiter ? How is positioned your FC on the frame ? Do you use foam, moongel etc. ? you have two GPS error in your log also (GPS-2 and GPS-0) but I don’t think they have to do with your problem.

My personal opinion,  that the current “wiki vibration range”, is good for old release (2.9 etc) but is not enough good for current release, where “inertial” need very very less vibration for works good. Last year I had issue similar and I saw a graph of vibration very similar to yours that seemed good, “in the range”, but I had very issue in alt hold and loiter, the altitude was very bad with motor pulsing. when I flew in stabilize all was OK. After that I was able to reduce vibration, the problem disappeared. If you want to try to reduce vibration with your current setup try  to change Thorttle_accel_P to 0.5000 (default 0.7500) and Thorttle Accel_I to 1.0000 (default 1.5000) and report here please.

303,Iris went haywire on first day.. :(,1,"Hi, I got my Iris today… and I crashed my Iris today. I started of with mostly Loiter mode using the regular RC remote… everything was working like a charm. I wanted to test the auto-stuff so I set up a mission, which also worked fine. After charging my batteries I went out for another auto mission. This time the Iris started acting strange. I hit the RTL, trying to get it to fly back. It just became more aggressive and started to fly higher and further away. I seemed to get it back after a while and again tried to get it to land, but it just wouldn’t. I desperately switched between different modes trying to gain control again but after just under a minute or so the Iris hit earth… Aside from two broken arms, props and motors I am more concerned over what actually happened… Why did I loose control? Even when I switched back to Loiter mode it didn’t comply… I’ve attached the logfile from the flight. Also… where can one get Iris spares, like motors, arms and props? They don’t seem to sell them at 3DR…","Some more information:   Just before the Iris started acting strange I had a flip-over on the ground (tall grass) and flipped it back by hand, could the upside-down experience have affected the behaviour experienced afterwards?   I went through the Initial Setup in Mission Planner procedure earlier that day, before I read that one should not do that with the Iris. I did not load the Iris parameters either, so it was basically configured and calibrated based on the Mission Planner Init Setup. This is my own theory why it behaved strangely, however I did fly it for 30 minutes or so prior to the auto mission haywire. It acted perfectly fine in Loiter mode, and I did a few return home and lands as well, with no problems noticed at all.   -ra"

Someone with more experience than I might recommend using a voltage meter to make sure your repair worked.

The Process is to power on your RC go to high throttle … once you disconnect and reconnect the battery you should get the standard beeps and then a long tone ( or beep) indicating that the High Throttle was captured and then go to Low Throttle and wait for a tone ( beep) to indicate that the low throttle was captured. Neither of these tones ( beeps) occurred, other than the standard 3 beeps, 2 beeps. the led does cycle through the colors as mentioned. I did and have considered that the motors may have been a source of the problem but I do have to do a process of elimination. I am almost ready to give up on the IRIS as I. Have had nothing but bad luck ( not lack of skill I fly two other quads without one tenth the problems) but I am not ready to give up yet.

Then leave at 100% and unplug and replug. On mine (I have the DIY kit not the IRIS) I then have to make sure I hold the safety switch to ‘arm’ it into calibration mode. Like I said, maybe that’s what you already did, but I thought it was worth at least mentioning just in case. I wasn’t getting the extra tone to signify that it had recognized the first boot with 100% throttle and it was very obvious the first time it worked. My issue was totally different though – my throttle wasn’t bound to CH3, so when I was booting at 100% throttle it was actually seeing it as 100% of a different input."

My setup: Cinetank Mk1 quad pixhawk with 3dr gps/compass frsky taranis and x8r receiver afro 30a escs lumenier(T motor) 2216 1100kv motors Power is from a 4s 3300 battery into the 3dr power module into the pixhawk. I soldered the 3dr power module in between the battery and the power distribution coin for the cinetank. So I believe I have everything setup as recommended. I have no backup power from the esc’s plugged in right now, just the signal and ground. I initially had the +, - and signal from each esc plugged into the pixhawk but removed the + connections to see if that made a difference - which it did not. I have log files but don’t know enough yet to make much use of them. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this problem would be highly appreciated!","Ok I tested it with cardboard on the props (I’ve been told its not good to run motors without some load on them), and with the throttle slightly up it doesn’t disarm. Someone at 3DR also verified its normal for it to disarm itself if it knows its on the ground and not moving. It also doesn’t sound like there’s an easy “hey pixhawk - you are on the workbench” setting to disable this feature. So I am now confident it was just disarming because of inactivity. Thanks for your reply Stefan - I was just about to take it completely apart to check all the wiring, now i’ll just tune it and fly!"

Comparing what I see in flight and what the log is telling me I’d say the baro returns correct data. The altitude change I am observing correlates quite well with the baro readings.

Under Calibration it gives me a measured voltage, etc… I was assuming since the APM shows me what the voltage is, and the “Sensor” item is disabled, the APM had a built in sensor (although probably with some restrictions)  which will allow it to know when the voltage is low. There is also under APM version, the AMP2.5+ - 3DR Power Module - Which I assumed would be used when you have the power Module.

The sensor which you would connect, is a voltage divider, which proportionally reduces the battery voltage to a range of 0-3.3V or 0-5V, depending on the sensor. If I remember correctly, the ATMEGA chip used in the APM has internal pull-up resistors which means, if nothing is connected, the chip measures 5V at the input, which the APM:Copter software then translates into a battery voltage according to the sensor configuration. I can see how that can fool somebody who is not familiar with the system , so not really a stupid question. Sent from my Ainol Novo 7 Fire using Tapatalk"

318,APM 2.6 Throttle Response Problem,1,"Hi, Am new to quadrotors and its my final year project. I have done a long research that took me 6 months to understand each individual part and how it operates. 1- Turnigy Talon Frame (Quadrotor) 2- Q-brain 4x25 A Esc (UBEC) 3- Ardupilot Mega 2.6 4- Frsky V8FR-II HV (Receiver) + DJT AF Module 5- 1100 Kv Turnigy Brushless motors 6- Turnigy 9XR (Transmitter) The problem is when i arm the APM everything is ok. The motors do not spin so its normal at lowest throttle but, when i turn the throttle up to 20% the motors still not spin at all. When i turn the throttle up to about 20% the motors suddenly spin in very high speed about (70%). I know its high speed because in the calibration mode the speed varies constantly unlike in normal flying mode. Notes: 1- When i calibrate the motors response is great and i calibrate the ESCs through APM ( Input receiver wires ) (Output ESCs signal wires). 2- I tried changing the gains of the throttle in the parameters list. ( nothing changed ). 3- When spinning the motors through the ESCs directly they response very well the same as the calibration mode while connected to the APM. I have been trying to solve this problem for 3 weeks now !!!   , If needed i can make a video showing the problem. Thank you",That sounds like exactly what happens when you take off in Altitude hold mode.  Double check your transmitter mode switch set up.  Taking off in stabilize mode is best.

320,Compassmot and Compass calibration linked together?,1,"Hi, as i understand from the doku it is best to do compass calibration outside in a wide field.

(would have the great advantage of not having to do the prop balancing again) Thanks for your Answers!",Compassmot measures the field strength in relation to either throttle (without power module) or amps (with power module). You don’t need to do it somewhere in the fields and your tent-spikes probably won’t matter if they are far enough away but you should avoid strong magnetic fields or unusual metal objects close to the compass while doing it.

I believe in sport mode, we interpret the stick input as a rate, so I don’t understand the lines [code] target_roll_rate = -constrain_int32(roll_angle, -ACRO_LEVEL_MAX_ANGLE, ACRO_LEVEL_MAX_ANGLE) * g.acro_balance_roll; target_pitch_rate = -constrain_int32(pitch_angle, -ACRO_LEVEL_MAX_ANGLE, ACRO_LEVEL_MAX_ANGLE) * g.acro_balance_pitch;[/code] Any insight gratefully received.","Thanks, yes, makes perfect sense.  I wasn’t considering the case of g.acro_balance_roll = 0."
322,Waypoint Transitions Too Abrupt,1,Has anyone plotted and flown a mission on the iris and noticed how the waypoint transitions are sudden and abrupt? I was curious if there was a way to increase the radius of the points (rounding the corners on a square). I looked into mission planner but can’t find anything in the configurations that will allow me to change how iris acts during waypoint transitions.,3.2 will do much smoother corners with splinenav. You can change WPNAV_RADIUS.

What I’m thinking is some kind of heavy base (at least heavier than the max static thrust of each motor/prop point) and securely attaching the hexa to it.

Is the fix implemented in 3.1.3 (Says nothing about it on changelog). Thanks.,"I had a response to one of my postings indicating that compassmot on pixhawk was fixed in “master”.  So I rebuilt the firmware from the “master” repository on github and loaded the compiled firmware to my pixhawk.  However, when I enter the terminal area it indicates “arducopter 3.1.2 dev” as the version and when I go to the setup menu, compassmot is not a recognized command. Looking at the code in master, I can see the fix in the AP_Compass_PX4.cpp on line 95: * but when I check the arducopter 3.1.2 github repository, the AP_Compass_PX4.cpp is vastly different and does not contain any reference to the division by zero fix. Perhaps someone can chime in here to let us know what it means when someone has closed this issue by “pushing the fix to master”…  and how do we rebuild the current release but with the (which?) updated AP_Compass_PX4.cpp to fix the division by zero nan compassmot issue? I realize that we could simply wait until it makes its way into the next release but since the fix was “completed” before 3.1.3 came out, and it didn’t make it in that release, perhaps its not in the main branch and needs to be addressed. Hopefully the gurus out there can chime in on this… Regards, Marco"

332,How to perform Compasmot on LARGE Octa,1,"So I have a 1.4M octa with 24KG total thrust. Obviously that is quite a lot! I am not sure it is even safe to provide full power to all 8 motors at the same time without damaging the landing gear (34kg load) or maybe shorting the PDB (Thought it is rated for this its still from china…). Thoughts on doing this? I don’t ever have very good yaw control, it normally has 5-10 degrees yaw “wag” during flight and I want to eliminate the compass as a problem before I do more extensive testing. Thanks!","As for the landing gear, I’d build a rig from stones or wood blocks to rest all arms on, which would spread the load evenly. As for the PDB… well - if you have doubts about that, you shouldn’t fly a 10kg 1,4m hedgetrimmer with that PDB in the first place ."

A motor without any prop has just a very little load and thus no strong magnetic field. I know the props you are using and the only way to execute a compassmot for you is to tie your quad down to something heavy. When I say “tie down” I mean tie down, the quad must have no possibility to take off. The object/ground etc. you are tying the quad to needs to be heavy enough (at least 10 times the maximum thrust of your engines) to ensure it will not move. I have seen videos where people used large wood plates with holes in it to tie down the quad with cable ties and large stones on the wood plate. Attention: Perform the compassmot only over the air and stay away from the quad! Cable ties are also no secure way to tie quad down. Use something that cannot open itself alone. And stay away when doing compassmot!!! And the last rule: Stay away!!! God damnit!  I don’t like this procedure either but it increases the accuracy of the inertial navigation system tremendously.

They have to be flipped and swapped, I believe. Like I said, I just restrain the copter. Zipties are plenty strong. If you have a current sensor, it does not matter how the props are configured, as long as all the motors are drawing equal current. I am trying to get compassmot learning done for 3.2. Compassmot is the most onerous part of our setup procedure, and I’d like to eliminate it. A side effect will be increasing accuracy - changing batteries, differences in current distribution between a hover and the test (which just sets all motors equal), etc. Compassmot learning will be able to correct a pretty large portion of the error on takeoff."

I’ll try and work out a safe way of tying it down with out decapitating myself or the local rabbits  jschall: that would be amazing, looking forward to automated facility. I’m still wondering - does compassmot really need to be done if you are using the external gps/compass module that sits six inches or so above the ESCs/motors?  I haven’t rushed to do this because my quad with pixhawk and external gps/compass is pretty solid at hover/loiter/auto flights.

Some portion of those conductors are in and on the battery. Depending on how close those conductors are in comparison to other conductors on the copter, it stands to reason that moving, rotating, or swapping out the battery can change the compassmot calibration vector. Compassmot does not need to be done when conductors are far away, though it can still make a difference. For example, I’ve done it on my y6, which has 90mm to the nearest ESC power wire (which is twisted). If you can send me a flight log with MAG enabled, I can tell you how much interference you have."

But flying without RC is NOT recommended. RC (tx) should be your main tool in case of failsafe. And of course all your tuning before any fly (even for RTF model) need an RC.

335,Pixhawk/APM Unflyable/Spontaneous Movements,1,"Hey Guys, Long time lurker, first time poster. I have a really weird, weird issue. It’s with a custom built Hex that I’ve had for 2.5 years and been flying on APM without an issue this whole time. So, I will try to describe what is happening during flight. Generally speaking, there is very little total control over the Hex. I give it a bit of throttle, it goes into a very “unstable looking” hover then with spontaneously want to pitch or roll. The more input I give it on the pitch, roll and yaw, the quicker it does this. I can give it 100% throttle whilst holding the Hex on the ground and it will spin all motors hard and generate full thrust, when it is in the air it will give out a maximum of what seems like 50% power. Sometimes when it lands and I go to give it power, it just won’t take off and spins the motors at what looks like 20-30% power, even though I am giving it up to 100% throttle. Now, that is flying in stabilise with “out of the box” tuning on both APM 2.6 and Pixhawk. When I fly Acro (with ACRO_TRAINER = 0) I get exactly the same issues. This has 5 of us all left scratching our heads. We were flying this Hex on an APM 2.6 (normally updating firmware as available) for months without an issue, I then had a fly away whilst in Loiter that resulted in a heavy crash.

I have another controller here but I want this Pixhawk to work. I am getting there but ran out of google search ideas. I find the instructions a bit lacking when you have a problem. When I did not have the modes it was probably something like not saving correctly etc. but there is no confirmation?? Thanks!",Your compass is going absolutely nuts. Where is it placed?
338,Autotune and AutoTrim,1,"Just wanted to know… This is not a problem. Hardware:  APM 2.6 External GPS / Compass) located roughly 50mm (1.968 inch) above the APM. Separate Battery and 5 volts voltage regulator for Receiver (FrSKy  D8R-II in CCPM mode) and APM. Speed Controllers: Dlux 70 A. Motors: Turnigy 3020B Space in between motors: 760mm (29.92 inches) Props:  330 x 102 (13 x 4 inches) Main battery: 4S 8,000 mAH  Software: V 3.1.4 ( I am aware  3.2-rc1 exists   ) After following recommended procedures, flew in stabilize, alt hold and loiter without problem (in no wind condition). As wind seemed to alter quite a bit the loiter mode, I decided to do an “Autotune”. I got then an extraordinary stable aircraft  :mrgreen: However wanted to have a great stability in Alt hold and stabilize. So allocated the [Save Trim] to channel 7, flew in ‘no wind’ condition. Used the Tx trims to get an almost perfect hover, landed, disarmed the Aircraft and activate the [Save Trim] channel. Next flight with Tx trims back to 0 showed that the trims values were saved in the EEPROM because it was almost perfect in Stabilize and Alt hold modes. Encouraged by the great results landed and next flight armed the motors in [Loiter mode] take off in that mode and the aircraft behaved pretty well. So what am I writing about?  Well the Loiter mode has lost the extraordinary stability it has at the beginning: About 1 to 2 meters horizontal movements in both x an y… Question: Is it better to do Trim (or auto trim) [color=#FF0000]before[/color] autotune? Sorry for the long post, but without details it is hard for anyone to comment. Thank you in advance for your comments. Henri","Getting your trim sorted out before you do autotune is a decent idea, but only because it might make it easier to keep the copter in the area during autotune. Sounds like you got a perfectly fine trim and tune. Loiter varies quite a bit due to GPS variability. Problems are highly unlikely to be caused by attitude controller tuning, and certainly have nothing to do with trim. If you’re trying to get a perfect loiter, there are 3 things you need: great GPS, great accelerometers, great compass. GPS: every time we release a trivial change to the code that couldn’t possibly affect loiter, people come out of the woodwork saying it ruined their perfect loiter. Well, impossible. We didn’t ruin it, the sunspots did. That meter that you are complaining about is 3 nanoseconds at the speed of light (timing that is how the GPS measures position.) Nonetheless, it might be possible to improve it. Make sure it is away from possible sources of interference, particularly FRSky radios, video transmitters and fpv cameras. Accelerometers: Vibration. There’s also the calibration routine. Compass: This is the fun one. It is a bit finicky. You’ve got to get a bunch of things right:  Hard-iron error. This is from magnetic material near the compass. Doing the calibration well should eliminate this source of error. Soft-iron error. This is from metals that deform magnetic fields. We don’t correct for this one yet. Keep the compass away from materials that have high magnetic permeability Motor interference. Move the compass as far away from high-current wires as possible, then run the compassmot calibration. Declination error. COMPASS_AUTODEC pretty much always gets this right. "

Please attach the .bin log from the SD card per the instructions in my sticky, but for now I’ll leave a few notes and questions based on what you’ve said: * 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 are identical except for a tiny bugfix that has nothing to do with “smoothness” * Yes, see above statement. However, compassmot can still be done if you’re determined to do it. I can send you a patched version with working compassmot, or you can install the very latest development build, run compassmot, and save the compassmot parameters from that. * This is probably due to inaccuracy in the inertial navigation, which would in turn most likely be caused by vibrations. Specifically what props are you using? It is strongly recommended that you use APC slow flyers, as they are the most efficient props you can buy. * Probably rate D terms too high. Try autotune. Run autotune with the minimum amount of battery that you would normally use and no payload. Note that you should have working althold before you try autotune, however."

I wondered about the corruption also as I notice that occasionally the IMU readings have large spikes in other logs I have seen (way outside what would be seemingly possible), when looking at the log in a text editor I noticed the IMU reading at the spike was due to an extra parameter that found its way into that log message. Thanks for the info on the 3.1.3.  I was hoping to compare the builds, but I guess there was no tag created for 3.1.2 so couldn’t compare the code to check. I can make the change for the compassmot fix, I believe its just the protection in the loop with regards to checking against a divide by zero.  Let me try rebuilding the 3.1.3 with compassmot fixed and redo the cal. I’ll try and run an auto tune with my lighter 3S battery to see if that fixes the “smoothness” prob + perhaps move to stiffer props?

[attachment=1]2014-05-05 10-59-25.log[/attachment] Looking at the log in this particular case vibrations seem higher, i’ll check the frame later to see why that might be.  Would that cause althold to do an erractic increase in height?  As althold uses Barrometer rather than GPS and the wind was less than 5kmh then wondering if there might be a prob with the sensor? Also, with regards to your earlier compass question I assume that you mean Pixhawk location?  I know that the UBLOX 3DR GPS also has a compass but I thought that the pixhawk code currently hard codes the use of the pixhawk internal compass rather than allowing for an external one? From the log I notice that when althold was enabled the altitude was being read as the coptor was increased in height, presumably meaning that the copter knew that it was increasing in height when in althold mode, just wondering why?  Again vibrations are a bit high so will try and see if I can do something about that.  Following is a plot of relalt and baralt both showing increase in height when althold was engaged.

Same condition seems to occur where a second or two into alt hold there is a burst increase in altitude, which I don’t allow to continue for more than a second or two more before taking control again (stabilize). Captured the .bin from the SDCard and you can see two occurances of alt hold invoked, in both cases the same thing happens: [attachment=1]9.BIN[/attachment] The vibration does seem to still be a little high (which I can now only attribute perhaps the to the props I am using).  However, even with this vibration I can’t explain why the pixhawk would seek a rapid increase in height when its Barrometer is telling it that it is gaining altitude.  In simple terms from the log what I seem to see is:  throttle increase (bursty) -> translating to increase in height reported by Barrometer, but throttle does not relent.  So, regardless of vibration why would it be ignoring the sensor input which is telling it that it is increasing in height yet it continues to push throttle up to increase height even more? Here is snap shot of the plot showing this: [attachment=0]Baralt_vs_throut.jpg[/attachment] I am noticing that that GPS is lagging a bit in Altitude response though, does GPS get used for alt-hold?  Might that factor?  I am basically trying to ascertain whether I have a bad HW part because the sooner I can show that the quicker I can get it replaced.

Please advise what I might be needing to tweak here.  Trying to rule out a HW prob. thanks Matt","Hi Jonathan, It’s “possible” I may found something HW wise that is contributing to the issue. Just to recap, I have two identical Y6B setups, both with Pixhawk & both using 3dr UBLOX GPS + compass.  Issue occurs on only one of them. I recently noticed that the copter that shows the burst height increase prob during alt hold seems to have a curious compass behavior.  I never noticed it before because after performing compass calibration I assumed all was good as theoffsets seemed reasonable etc.  However, what I am noticing is that when level the compass seems ok, but if you pitch slightly the compass direction starts to spin.  To be clear I am not alterring heading (yaw) only pitch.  This is NOT the case on the other Y6B, whose compass heading remains rock solid as the copter is pitched (by hand). To try and isolate things I took the 3DR ublox from the “working” y6b setup and connected it up to the other setup and recalibrated the compass to get the new offsets.  However, I continue to see the same issue.  Reading that ArduCopter 3.1.4 indicated some potential probs on I2C are fixed and knowing that compass from ublox goes over I2C I tried 3.1.4 FW, but no diff.  It seems the Pixhawk HW, in this case, may be somehow to blame? Having said the above one “workaround” has presented itself.  The internal compass of the pixhawk on the failing setup works fine.  If I remove the i2c connection from ublox to pixhawk and recalibrate the compass once again (this time it would be using Pixhawk’s internal compass as I guess the code auto detects that no compass is attached to i2c) then the compass behavior seems ok.  Meaning that if I now pitch the copter the compass heading does not spin. Is it generally better to use the Pixhawk’s compass in setups like this where you could be using either 3dr ublox or pixhawk?  Perhaps the i2c voltage is too high marginally on the bad setup from pixhawk to ublox, but marginally ok enough on the other pixhawk ublox setup?  I’ll try alt hold test again with using the pixhawk compass instead and see where things are at. cheers"

In other times when Loiter has been engaged there is certainly an increase in throttle, but not always a hard slam to 100%.  However, in this particular case/log it was.  As you can see I put back to stabilize within a second or two of engaging Loiter. I notice in the vibration logs that there appears to be periods of relatively decent vibration, followed by periods that show a high degree of vibration, so wondering if that is contributing, although not sure why it would be vibrating so much worse than the other identical Y6 frame, (perhaps the very flexible props are playing a roll here?).  Also, HDOP appears to be pretty decent throughout from a GPS perspective. The other thing I am noticing is that even in normal Stabilize mode the copter’s motors appear to be “fluttery” is the best way I can describe the sound/motion. Please advise what I might be needing to tweak here.  Trying to rule out a HW prob. thanks Matt","ALT_HOLD holds altitude in exactly the same manner as loiter. It uses the height estimation from the complementary filter. If the accelerometers are bad, the complementary filter does not work. How did you go with compassmot? I’m hoping to fix a few bugs and get a 3.1.5 release done."

Trying to rule out a HW prob. thanks Matt","Hi Jonathan, Compassmot cal appears to work fine, in as far as it calibrates without giving me NAN’s anymore and I get what appear to be reasonable values in the compass mot params. I continue to have issues with Alt hold so i am trying to go the very basics to see if I can figure out what is going on.  In the vibration graphs provided on some of my flights I notice that I am seeing periods of good vibration interspersed with periods of vibration out of spec.  I tried an experiment and perhaps this experiment is not valid, but it seemed to be an obvious thing to try:  Powered the pixhawk up through USB connection only (no battery connected to minimise any sort of EM noise). Armed the copter and increased throttle to 50% in stabilize, when to alt hold mode etc. Took the log at the end.  So, clearly in this flight the copter is not moving in anyway, it is on a flat surface and there were no vibrations in the house, yet when I look at the vibration plots from the log of this I see periods of relative increase in vibration.  Now this I really can’t explain, unless this is a HW issue with the pixhawk? Please see the graph below followed by the .bin file: [attachment=1]accx_y_not_moving2.jpg[/attachment] [attachment=0]2.BIN[/attachment] There appears to be some gross inaccuracies here, or I am doing an experiment that is simply not valid (why?).  The other thing I noticed is that observing things in flight data (that provides the artificial horizon etc) I can see that mission planner is reporting that things are pitching/rolloing slightly.  Slightly I say, however given the copter is on a solid surface that is not at all moving I would expect that to not pitch or roll at all?  I should mention that the compass is rock solid and does not move at least. In addition if you look at this log and plot the relalt & baralt they both show a gradual climb of 4 meters over the period of the log.  Both them seemingly in lock step with one another thinking this?  GPS slightly lags baralt, but I find that curious that both height indications are showing a drift of 4m upwards when the craft is not moving at all.  The fact that both sensors are saying this seems to  indicate a SW issue as I can’t imagine both HW failing in the same way? Is my experiment invalid?  What am I missing here.  Or do I genuinely perhaps have bad HW?"

You are probably comparing CTUN.BarAlt with GPS.RelAlt. GPS.RelAlt is misleading - it does not come from the GPS, instead it is the inertial navigation altitude, which is a complementary filter that uses the accelerometers in the short term and barometer in the long term. Normal for it to track the barometer. It lags the barometer because it is being slowly dragged towards the barometer - it relies on the accelerometers to measure rapid movements. If you take a look at GPS.Alt, you’ll see it is terrible. It jumps by 50 meters at one point. Doesn’t matter, we don’t use it for that reason.   Roll and pitch jump around because of noise in the GPS velocity measurement, which is used in the attitude solution.  "

Is there anything I can help with gathering more data on this issue, so that you can better address it in the new version? Also any idea on a workaround in the meantime? I guess I could introduce vibrations by a non-balanced prop and thereby hope I’m not within the aliasing range anymore. Would that work? Also, as this was on a stock IRIS without any modifications I’m concerned that there will be other folks hitting exactly the same issue. I’ve seen some reports which could point in this direction, Last but not least: Would it make sense to update the log how to with the information on the aliasing as seen via Chan Out? That way other people can quicker determine if they are hitting this issue. Chris"

On a stock consumer version IRIS, the uBlox GPS module touches the Pixhawk, transferring vibrations from the engines via the frame into the hull and via the uBlox into the Pixhawk. Maybe because of the shape of the hull serving as a damper itself these vibrations appear to be along the z-axis and also sporadic. Isolating the Pixhawk from the GPS again will make these sporadic spikes go away, so that the vibrations look like the white noise that it should be again. Have a look at this * for more details."

It demonstrates no toilet-bowling behavior whatsoever and both the GPS and compass work perfectly.  Loiter works exactly as it should as well. My problem is this simple:  It just overshoots any movements on RTL badly.  If it needs to go up another 50 feet, it shoots up more to like 100 and then settles back down.  If it needs to go 50 yards west to return home, it goes 75 yards west then wanders its way back.  It overshoots every direction in every axis every single time.  Upon landing, it lands within three to four feet of home every single time. Here’s the tuning page:  * That hasn’t helped me as it doesn’t address my specific problem.

349,Pixhawk + APM 3.1.3 + RTL overshoot,14,"I’m the proud owner of three Pixhawks (bcdebusk is my 3dr account name too).  Using 3.1.3 My other custom builds are nothing short of amazing. Quad works perfect in Stabilize, Alt-Hold and Loiter. Autotune made this thing work like magic. RTL always RTLs within feet of home position. Loiter works great too.  It stays perfectly still in the air.  But when I flip the switch to RLT, I get unusually high descents or ascents.  And it always overshoots its landing zone an the X-Y axis too, but makes a correction, and lands perfectly.   I’ve done the prerequisite web searches, and it refers me to older version of navigation tuning that make references to parameters that 3.1.3 doesn’t even have.   Could someone please tell me the adjustments I need to make using the latest Mission Planner and 3.1.3?   Thank you in advance.  If you solve this problem 3DR, I’ll order a fourth pixhawk before the end of the week (and you know my username, so you can fact check me). Thank you in advance, Brian","You nailed it.  I still have a little bit of latitude and longitudinal ripple, but swapping-out the Pixhawk-standard foam for the foam I normally use solved the altitude variability problems 100%. P.S. I had no idea the foam I was normally using was so effective.  I’ve done several custom builds with it and didn’t realize other people even had problems with vibrations.  I simply took a dual-layer adhesive-backed foam we use for medical products a work and as it turns-out, it’s the ultimate vibration-killer. Thank you again."

351,Taranis X8R SBus to PixHawk- Throttle problems,1,"Hi I had my PixHawk on a DJIF550 Hexa Frame with the new DJI E300 propulsion kit, controlled with a Spektrum DX9 and a HobbyKing R800x receiver that has SBus out connected to the PixHawk RC-IN port, and was working ok, after some tweaks. Radio calibration on all channels had the range between 1088 and 1940. The ESC’s from the DJI E300 kit are optocoupled and don’t support calibration. The arming procedure of the PixHawk, that made the props rotate after arming was working ok with MOT_SPIN_ARMED of 130, but I had to tweak the RC_IN MIN of the Throttle to 1122 to have a smooth rotation on idle after arming. I swapped the Radio Control system to a Taranis X9D + X8R receiver because the extra channels PWM could be hooked directly to a 3 axis gimbal. The X8R receiver was set to Mode 4, i.e. 16 channels output with the last 8 exposed on the receiver PWM pins, and was connected to the PixHawk via the SBus to RC_IN same as before. I redid the Radio Calibration and on all the first 8 channels the range is between 982 and 2006. The last 8 channels are also ok and control the gimbal perfectly (output range also between 982 and 2006). This brought some issues with the arming procedure on the PixHawk. Now when I arm the PixHawk the props won’t spin, and I have to move the throttle until it reaches +/- 1150 value to have the props spinning. So now my throttle was a small “dead zone” at the bottom where the props won’t spin, i.e. I arm the PixHawk, no props spin, raise the throttle and props start to spin at 1150, and increase normally until max speed, when lowering the Throttle the props STOP around 1150 down to the 982 lower value of the throttle value. I’ve already messed with MOT_SPIN_ARMED from 0 up to the max of 270 with no solution. I also looked at THR_MIN but besides not understanding from what the percentage is referring to (percent of what) and no matter what I use on the allowable range nothing changes on the behavior above. Anyone has any tips on how to have the motors spinning at the current minimum throttle? I’m sure others here also use the Taranis+X8R+Pixhawk combo but not many with the E300 propulsion kit, but your inputs are welcome. TIA Luis","I managed to get a solution with the help of DJI The E300 ESC’s have a range of 1120 to 1920. The solution in this case is to set the Throttle channel limits on the radio, so that the PixHawk sends 1120 at minimum and 1920 at max throttle. One can accomplish this using the RC Calibrate screen to check the output values, while changing the limits on your radio. After this step, perform a standard radio calibration, and problem solved. rgds"

I numbered my questions:   I never been to more than 20 meters height from the ground, so there must be something really wrong in the barometer… I suppose that the barometer should measure the height from the sea level… am i correct? Or are you expecting to read the height from the ground?   I also opened the generated google earth file, and the google earth altitude graph is NOT coherent with the apm gps altitude log:  It seems to me that the altitude in the kmz file is different than the the gps log and different than the barometer log… and i can see height jumps on google earth graph… how is these data obtained?(if it’s complicated to explain, don’t care this quesiton)   Anyway, let’s back to the logs: do you usually see the gps altitude coherent with the barometer altitude on a working setup?    Do you usually cover the APM with something dark? is the barometer sensitive to light, to electromegnetic wave generated by the sun or to heat generated by the sun? i think that electromegnetic wave can not be stopped by a cover. Did you see that my APM has the plastic cover on it? it is not completely transparent. Any suggestion on this point?  5)How could i deeply investigate on this barometer problem?  A newbye question: the total number of samples is about 4000, which is the delay from a sample and the next one? how many milliseconds?   no, i’m using a clone of the 3dr power module and it doesn’t include the BEC, for this reason i’m using a BEC of one ESC to power the APM. what do you mean for “a touch on the low side” ?

355,"RTL rocketed copter away from launch to powerlines, why?",1,"Hi all, Would you please help me to dig reason of these series of problems which caused hard crash and help to avoid this in the future. It should have been normal heavy camera copter gimbal pitch axis tuning test flight, gimbal roll axis was locked. Flight ended to unpowered power lines and crashed. I got footage from copter and helmet camera. Log file is attached. Firmware is V3.1.2 (ddd4d881). What happened: copter was on ALT HOLD when I noticed that left stick was mechanically stuck so that YAW worked only to right side. Throttle was fine. Radio has done this earlier but I assumed reason to be a stone I found from stick bottom. Perhaps it wasn’t. This flight was certainly last for this 9XR radio. After realizing stick problem I was trying to switch STABILIZE and land but logs tells opposite, APM was switched to RTL. Most likely this was human error. Copter was just above the launch. When RTL was activated, copter took of high speed away from launch, spinned one full round to left (stick was stuck to center-right) and then boosted to power lines. This leaves one very good question: Why and where copter boosted when RTL was activated. I have done earlier vibration test with unbalanced propels and it has been very smooth. And after that propels are balanced. Also compassmot is done and it gave result 13%. Current is high 100A-140A on normal flight but compass and GPS are about 100mm from power cables and more from ESC:s. ESC:s are calibrated and compass declinations entered manually. Every setting in APM is like it has been on earlier flights. AUTO flight settings I haven’t touched. One thing is what might be related to problem but I can’t be sure. Compass wasn’t in its place after crash, like pretty much any component on top of the copter because it dropped upside down. Why I’m wondering this is that compass was only glued in its place and were waiting plastic screws to arrive. I have checked its firmly in place prior to every flight but this is in theory possibility that compass is teared off. One full round to left was a thing why I’m wondering this because I couldn’t have done it. But I can’t find any proof for this from logs. I wish it was a problem and therefore is easy to solve and avoid in the future. Video: * In the end, no one get hurt and crash offered good opportunity to rebuild few things better which I have found during building . Price of the crash after full immediate disassembly was: full reassembly, all carbon booms, test bench result 7 motors, 6 propels, one main plate, one battery and something I haven’t found yet.","You did not log MAG,  but generally speaking, you should test loiter, then test some more - with speed - before expecting RTL to work. RTL flyaways are “always” caused by bad GPS, or bad magnetormeter. your HDOP seems to go to 99.99 (no fix) before crash. test, test , test."

When RTL was activated, copter took of high speed away from launch, spinned one full round to left (stick was stuck to center-right) and then boosted to power lines. This leaves one very good question: Why and where copter boosted when RTL was activated. I have done earlier vibration test with unbalanced propels and it has been very smooth. And after that propels are balanced. Also compassmot is done and it gave result 13%. Current is high 100A-140A on normal flight but compass and GPS are about 100mm from power cables and more from ESC:s. ESC:s are calibrated and compass declinations entered manually. Every setting in APM is like it has been on earlier flights. AUTO flight settings I haven’t touched. One thing is what might be related to problem but I can’t be sure. Compass wasn’t in its place after crash, like pretty much any component on top of the copter because it dropped upside down. Why I’m wondering this is that compass was only glued in its place and were waiting plastic screws to arrive. I have checked its firmly in place prior to every flight but this is in theory possibility that compass is teared off. One full round to left was a thing why I’m wondering this because I couldn’t have done it. But I can’t find any proof for this from logs.

You are right. I should have tried Loiter first but RTL wasn’t test plan today and neither Loiter. RTL was accidental and I didn’t plan to do it before testing flight modes in order how documentation tells to test. That was planned to be future testing and RTL was there just because upcoming law in Finland seems to require so. Just a backup even not tested yet. Back in to topic; if magnetometer and GPS fails on RTL, what exactly APM is supposed to do? There are still information available if copter has acceleration to some direction and without deeper knowledge of APM code I guess it should try to hover still, not accelerate at full speed  to random direction. I believe there is something not yet discovered in this crash. RTL “Float away” or force throttle reduction would be understandable."

So, without GPS and Compass information copter could fly where ever and speed is SET in some parameter, which one? Is there parameter which makes copter trying to hover and waiting that 5 seconds rather than speeding randomly? This double problem seems to produce uncontrolled high risk behavior. GPS value is currently monitored, should Compass be as well? On EU we’ll have strickt regulations soon for RPAS and requirement for risk assesment wouldn’t surprise. Lowering any risk created by autopilot in any abnormal situation might be smart to have high priority on development now. If Finnish (partially based on some earlier regulations somewhere) regulations this year goes through as proposed, it means that any single failure can’t cause accident. We could think what this means to our hobby. By the way, has anyone done risk assesment for autopilot? I mean a chart where all sensors and critical components are listed and if any of those are in malfunction, result is written to particular line. At least for all known single failure situations."

Maybe it’s reason you are go to RTL mode. What happened in RTL is obvious, GPS give the right position but compass give the wrong direction, your copter goes the wrong way.

What  happened, was that it build up speed in (wrong) direction, and lost GPS while at speed, there’s no “break” feature without GPS.  So it just kept travelling at what would finally be the speed of wind, unless getting GPS back. “No single fault can cause accident”, is a nice goal, not always achivable, even commercial airlines have some systems, that can cause a disaster in the right circumstances, like MD80’s jackscrew for horizontal stabilizer.   It’s all about minimizing the risk thru maintenance and proper routines. -assuming your CAA rules are not very different from Norwegian ones, you should minimize the risk, and a risk assesment does not require 0 risk, but acceptable risk.  So you may say main battery connector fault would be a disaster, but the chance of it to fail is small, because you have soledred it at correct temperatures therefore risk is acceptable. CAA does not ask you to do risk assessment for APM/Pixhawk, but the whole UAS. And yes - I do use Ardu* professionally, with permissions from CAA and Norwegian National Security Authority"

There are two copter operators on panel, so they should have some influence for reality. Duplicating every possible failing part is one option (at least sensors and connectors), but is not possible currently. If I have understood correctly for avoiding same accident I need to: switch stabilize immediately when something abnormal is happening and from settings side divide that traveling speed at least for 10. Any other ideas for avoiding very fast uncontrolled speedings like that are very welcome."

I checked radio PWM values and they were 988, 1500 and above 2000. So this leaves only two options, program failure or my own mistake which is most likely. This is assumption what happened based on what I’ve read so far and found from logs:  Left stick didn’t work properly and made me confused, copter was at alt hold Confusion caused irrational action to switch RTL instead of Stabilize Magnetometer perhaps was teared off and caused copter to speed to wrong direction, away from spot where it was supposed to land. It was already on top of landing spot On the way to who knows where copter lost GPS and spinned one round without knowing its heading Copter flew to power lines  So quite a series of problems. I have slight flashback that I switched to stabilize before crash on time when copter spinned around. But another memory flashback is that I wondered why copter don’t fall even throttle is zero. I don’t know which was first. These needs to be checked. Still I don’t get it why copter speed to some direction if it already was on top of the landing spot and why so fast. It didn’t need to go anywhere, just land even spinning If this is not logical conclusion, is wrong or do not contain all details, please guys let me know."

Still RTL will work first. Even it start land, but your GPS is working, it will use the GPS data to keep in the landing spot, with the wrong compass, it still will go to wrong direction. Fast. Because more distance to home, more speed will have. Your GPS give the right information about the distance. It should work if your disconnect the GPS.

First off, make sure you’re starting out in stabilize mode and you have 3.1.3. Second, set your THR_MID lower. If you have a log I may be able to tell you how much lower. Then, start lowering the roll and pitch gains in proportion (i.e, if you set P to half of its original value, set I and D to half their original values) until the copter stops oscillating. Next switch to alt hold mode and lower THR_ACCEL_P and THR_ACCEL_I until the copter no longer oscillates. If the copter rapidly diverges from its altitude in alt hold mode with the stick centered, then you have a problem with vibration. Same if it rapidly diverges from its altitude while maneuvering (though a few meters of descent can be expected when flying fast). Next run autotune."

361,Auto tune crash with tricopter,1,"Hello, I have a tricopter I built which uses HobbyKing 20A ESC’s flashed with SimonK and DT750 motors. I tried using auto tune and it twitched twice and then just flipped over and slammed in to the ground. I downloaded the log file (I think this is the right one) and was wondering if someone could help me out. I’ve read that pancake motors and SimonK ESC’s can have sync problems, so that may be the issue. I’m going to try to ref lash the ESC’s with Wii ESC firmware and see if that solves it, but I’d like to figure out if the problem is something else first to avoid slamming this thing in to the ground again. Thanks in advance!!","I have a similar setup.  At first I was using 30A Mystery ESCs with simonk to run the DT750 motors and had sync issues.  I switched to hobbyking blue 30A with simonk and haven’t had a problem since.  I did this testing a year and a half ago so things may have changed. My testing method for sync issues on the ground is to simply remove the props, arm the APM,  and then aggressively move the sticks.  I found it I moved the sticks enough eventually a DT750 would lose sync and squeal on the ground without props with the bad ESCs. I can’t say the ESCs were bad other than they were not a good fit with the DT750 motor."

The program isn’t magic, and it cannot accommodate baro data that is that bad.  With an altitude error of 140m, it’s going to crash if the pilot doesn’t take back control. I actually suspect that the problem was due to light hitting the barometer, as that is much more likely to cause such a large spike than any aerodynamic effects. How do you control the descent rate, when you don’t know the altitude, and thus don’t know the rate of change of altitude?"

To avoid that crash, we need to imagine an integrity test for baro data as we did for GPS glitch. If barometer data is corrupted , motors should be driven from actual throttle to calculated hover throttle in a ramp. The final throttle should be 50% moderated by throttle stick position to allow some kind of altitude control immediately . Also a error message should be sent over mavlink. The baro data integrity check should try to compare altitude variations against 10m/s or so and even to correlate with Z acceleration or GPS alt. My crash log presented in first post shows IMU 50Hz data, GPS data and baro data, we could use it to set the filter threshold. And if you are not going to do anything with this bug, at least write with red letters on Arducopter instalation to check the sponge over baro or else…"

I have a hover throttle of about 400, you can imagine what happens then. This happens also after a successful mission, when in landing mode - very funny, with our cars nearby… My data flash log doesn´t show any altitude signals, i always have to investigate via Throttle Out or Climb Rate, anyone an idea why there is no baro logging (i selected for logging “nearly all” values)? Foam: I bought a board with a fixed, soldered shield, the idiot forgot the foam on the baro, so i will improvise a cover. By the way, in elder versions of APM, my sonar showed values in the “altitude” signal in lower height, now there is absolotely not even a “sonar voltage”, but in the terminal window in debug, its perfect.

My problem is when switching from ALT mode to Stab the motors spin faster and i loose control of copter. Its like it uses other commands. it will either pull up fast or flip. Is their some kind of Param settings to make it dead steady when switching modes? has any one have this problem ?,"*, Providing tlogs and/or data flash logs will help to troubleshoot your issue.

I am talking about auto takeoff though, where the multirotor is switched into auto while on the ground, armed, and then as soon as the throttle is blipped, the autopilot takes over.

I’m not sure land detection is the problem here tho because we are only doing auto takeoff after a power up and arm. We have also tried after auto land and disarm and results are the same. We found that ramping up the throttle in stabilize to just before takeoff then switching into Auto helps a lot and it throttles up much smoother. It’d be really nice to have a takeoff throttle ramp speed parameter but it sounds like there isn’t one so that answers my question

There is actually something in the program which makes the copter try to jump to 20cm altitude when it first takes off.  This is done because it was felt that it’s safer to get the copter up and clear of the ground ASAP.  This prevents problems where the landing gear are dragging in the grass as the controller starts to pitch/roll to hold position. Some people like it, some don’t.  It’s one of the compromises we have to deal with. However, if it’s jumping more than that, like 1+ meters, then there is definitely some issue that we would need logs to diagnose."

We’ve changed the parameter so that the motors spin when armed, then when switching to AUTO and bumping the throttle for takeoff, this seems to takeoff a little less aggressively. My guess is because we are using large, slower motors it takes longer for them to start up from stopped, so by the time they are spinning, the APM is outputting high throttle percent to make it get up to 20cm.  If the altitude is PI controlled, the I term would build up while the motors are starting.  Maybe that’s not the case and it’s just P control. Anyway, we are really happy with the takeoff procedure now with the motors spinning on arming.  Thanks for all the hard work!"

366,Alt hold? or is it?,1,"Sorry for the wordy post. I had a crash the other day because I got too low and hit a tree. I was in alt hold. I was looking at my tablet / telemetry concentrating on it’s orientation and didn’t notice until too late it had dropped from 60 meters to 30. I’m not positive why that happened could be I moved the throttle while moving the yaw. But that brings up my point that,  is it just me or is it hard to maintain an altitude even in alt hold? I know on a dji the left stick spring loads to the center and it will maintain that altitude until you make a change. I have the notches in the throttle and generally I don’t have a problem doing the yaw without moving the throttle BUT I do find it irritating I’m never quit sure if I have my stick in the right place i.e. is it slightly gaining or losing altitude? Slightly losing is BAD!  There seems to be about a %30 ‘dead band’ in the center where the throttle makes no change when in alt hold. So to gain altitude one must push the stick past say %60 then to stop it from continuing to climb you must bring it down to around %30. Then I usually just try to put it about in the middle.

Without ANY information it is pretty much impossible to make any determinations! Please post a logfile… Many things can influence alt hold.

I was interested if the %30 or so dead band [ in alt hold ] so to speak of the left stick is normal or is there some setting I am unaware of?  I would like to make that smaller so it required far less travel to effect altitude in alt hold AND know with certainly that the alt with not change so long as the stick is in the center. Obviously that would require proper set up with each craft but I’m not seeing anyway for that to be consistent despite my best efforts. Also are there any thoughts by the 3gr guys on the alt hold mode being made to work like the phantom with a spring loaded throttle stick? Or maybe I should call it the altitude stick. On the dii this is basically just an altitude change stick as apposed to the pihawk set up where it’s throttle and altitude both which is where I have encountered inconsistencies albiet from pilot error no doubt but inconsistencies none the less. I’m not trying to compare dii and the pixhawk. The pixhawk is miles ahead of the dii I think. But… I do think they have done some darn nice things with that platform and having the craft ‘stick’ where you put it regarding altitude in the same way loiter does horizonaly would be nice. I’d like to know I can push the stick forward and know it’s not going to drop 10 meters or more if I don’t have my left stick in the EXACT right spot. Seems like alt hold should me just that. Although it could be the user set up isn’t as good as it should be.

I can eventually get the quad to maintain it’s altitude and confirm this with the telem but it take a 2-3 minutes to be sure. That’s %20-%30 of the flight time. Hey I’m good right I figured that out all by myself!   Another thing… if it’s up there 50-60 meters it’s almost impossible to discern if it’s gaining or losing a little altitude simply by eye. I think this is what bit me the other day. Granted I have telemetry but seems one should be able to know his or her craft is ‘locked’ at that altitude without having to rely on that. In fact many people fly without that all all.

Is there something I can do to have similar confidence in alt hold with the pixhawk ??","I moved this to Copter/3.1 because it’s software-related Altitude loss can be caused by many things. Z-vibrations are one thing that can throw the altitude controller off. There also have been reports of changing altitude in fast forward flight due to aerodynamic effects. That’s why I asked a log file. The deadband is in the software and it’s intended - exactly for that reason, so that you don’t have take care about precisely centering the stick. I personally don’t know if it can be changed but I’m sure some developer will ring in here. As for changing the sticks - you can use whatever transmitter you please with the Pixhawk and I believe, many if not most transmitters can be modified so that the throttle axis is also spring-loaded. For most quality-transmitters, stick gimbals are available as spares, so just buy one with 2 springs and you should be fine. The function of the throttle stick in APM:Copter depends on the mode. In Stabilize it’s a throttle stick and in Loiter/alt hold, it controls the vertical movement of the copter. IIRC, since 3.01, you can take off in other modes than stabilize, so you actually don’t need to use this mode at all if you don’t want to. Of course, it would be wise to be able to control the Copter in Stabilize, because that way, you can always rescue it if one of the assisted modes should go bad, e.g. through bad GPS reception."

I did auto tune and and then did several flights keeping close attention to the stick centered and watching the altitude on my telemetry in alt hold… and it does in fact keep the same alt with the stick centered. Much better than I thought.  My crash into a tree was probably pilot error. Flying around at high speed it would descend on pitch forward and ascend on pitch back 4 meters or so.

Yes, a sprung-center Tx is the solution to this.  Unfortunately, the programmers can’t do anything about that.   I actually built myself a custom transmitter, and one of the features I implemented was the sprung-center throttle stick.  I love it too. Yes, you can rise-fall 4m when flying around due to Bernoulli effect on the barometer.  Not much we can do about it at this point unfortunately."

If there was an extremely small dead band and a spring to center TX stick you would know your input was effecting the altitude because you could feel yourself moving the stick against the spring pressure. This would give a secondary stimulus to what you perceive is happening not just visual which is often very hard if not impossible to discern at altitude!

Then, after a second, it goes back to level. I noticed it going back to level the first time it happened because it surprised me before I could hit loiter. Later on as it kept happening, I was able to flip loiter fast enough. I talked to someone about this and he told me that it could be an Integral Overshoot from the PID gains. This seems to be happening whenever I stop forward flight or go for a turn. I didn’t really notice it happening when IN forward flight. If anyone could provide any info on what is going on, it would be much appreciated.

Your Pitch Rate I-term should be at least equal to P-term.  And the Imax should be 500 absolute minimum, but you can try increasing it in 500 point steps.

On the compass setup screen in MP, you see some pictures.  The first picture is a Pixhawk and the last picture is of the 3DR GPS/Magnetometer module that ships with every Pixhawk. So which compass module do you choose?  Don’t choose the 3DR GPS module – choose the Pixhawk.  Every Pixhawk relies on that compass so while it might make sense to choose the GPS module that looks exactly what you have in your hand, pick the stand-alone Pixhawk. If you don’t, here’s what happens:   The compass calibration will work just fine.   When you measure your calibration versus a second source (I used a compass on my Android phone), they’ll line-up just fine.   The moment you go from Stabilize or Alt-Hold to GPS loiter, your craft will bank hard and just take off.  Don’t wait it out – it will just keep going.   That’s probably not what’s happening to you, but I figure every little bit helps."

Got the auto trim for both the Stabilize & Rate / Roll & Pitch done per this video I’ve watched before but never implemented it until a friend on Facebook suggested it: * . Before I did that, Miko (the Facebook friend) commented about the location of the receiver perhaps being too close to the compass. He got me thinking about the location of all the components. I though the battery being off center just might be a contributing factor so I moved it to the center for now. When the gimbal comes in I’ll move it back for balance. One other thing I did was to wait until the HDop dropped below 2 and Satellite count was up around 9 or 10 before starting the trim. I think when HDop goes up, all bets are off for any GPS dependent mode. Just moving battery to center (balancing the aircraft) solved a large portion of the jitters. Then I fine tuned Stabilize & Rate / Roll & Pitch with channel 6 on the transmitter per the above video. Here is mine now: *. This is a heavy lift coptor so it has tons of reserve power to have to deal with. Here are my new PID settings."

By the way, the 4 different options of picking your compass type, as you mentioned, has only to do with one thing…setting the correct orientation for the compass. The different options of picking the 3DR, pixhauk, manual etc is just to facilitate getting your orientation right. With the incorrect compass orientation setup, yes, it will fly rapidly away when in Loiter…the onboard computer is doing what is is programmed to do, but just in the wrong direction.

HDOP shows under 2 at all times in MP live. I don’t see a lost signal when I am enter Loiter. I am watching the GPS live or have someone watch it while I enter Loiter.

At least that’s what I thought. (that’s it showed live) I read the code…5 sec is very bad. If this is accurate, there is no way Loiter will work loosing 5 secs GPS signal at a time. Yours does not show this GPS error on your log graphs at all? Anyone else? Maybe looking at the MP’s live flight data and staring at the hdop and # of satellites is not the way to observe a gps glitch. (Although it makes sense to me that a 5 second loss of signal would show in the hdop and # of Sat) Is there a dedicated graph in flight data live to see a GPS glitch? (clicking “tuning” box to pull up the live graph) If not, is there a graph to display from the data flash logs showing GPS glitches? I would like to verify the duration and where in the flight it happened…and how often this glitch repeated in the same flight."

I start getting 20 before even taking off. I  switched receivers. Was using a receiver for “Devo 10” and then tried a DSM2 receiver which always gave a rock solid signal for me for years. No difference, about same # of rxerrors which is not possible. Something must be wrong with all my boards and/or them accepting a clean code…they are all from goodluckbuy. Nice selection for the graph. I am going to check out my RSSI and Noise Floor levels. I am not familiar with noise floor, what kind of noise it is and what are normal acceptable readings…I going to do a little research on that. Thanks for sharing. Well, at this point I only have one solution and it is going to cost me. I am going to order a new APM 2.6 and the LEA-6H GPS directly from 3DRobotics. (I already have 2 power/current modules I bought directly from them) What version do you have?  Where did you get yours? It has to work then…if it doesn’t it is something else like my ESC’s, motors, wiring…which I doubt. Once I get everything working 100% and consistently, I will work backwards by method of substitution to find out how can 3 APM 2.6 boards be bad. I will get to the bottom of this!!! and when I do, I will be able to help folks with what I learned!!! But for right now, I just want to fly, film, do multiple waypoint missions, do “auto” circles, test and play with geofence."

Below is the “Loiter Performance” graph looking pretty bad, 2 pairs of lines should be practically on top of each other (parallel) *","I just did a test to validate the context of the rxerrors metric by connecting mission planner to the copter via the 3DR Radios and watching the graph of the rxerrors, remote rssi, remote noise, local rssi and local noise. When all was connected I was producing the same graph observed in my the previous post. When I disconnected the power from the copter, the remote rssi dropped and the errors went up. When reconnected the power to the copter everything was restored. I didn’t turn on the R/C transmitter bound to the R/C receiver in any portion of this test. This tells me the context for 5 metrics rssi, remrssi, noise, remnoise and rxerrors is the 3DR Radio telemetry communication opposed to the R/C transmitter / receiver. I don’t think changing your R/C receiver from the “Devo 10” to the DSM2 is going to influence the rxerrors metric. I’m using a very old JR 10X with a Spektrum DM9 DSM2 module and an AR9000 Spektrum receiver with one satellite receiver and the PPM Encoder between the receiver and the Pixhawk. The noise floor is the static noise you hear on your AM radio when it is not tuned to any broadcast station. It’s a term commonly used in the amateur radio community to specify the minimum receiver signal level necessary to hear another station. If you’re below the noise floor, it’s very difficult to interpret what is being communicated. I was going to suggest putting the FC in a different copter or just assembling the components on the bench for troubleshooting if it isn’t too much trouble. This would tell you if it’s the installation or one of the components. Identification of the issue is 50% of the solution  Dave (W4DJW)"

Below is the “Loiter Performance” graph looking pretty bad, 2 pairs of lines should be practically on top of each other (parallel) *","So the “rxerrors” is for analyzing the the telemetry radios signal/code, not the tx/rx signal? That is odd, I need to research that, not that I don’t believe your data analysis. The developers know RX has always stood for receiver in the rc hobby industry. The telemetry radios are never really called receivers. The are actually not receivers, the are trans-receivers that both transmit and receive, both air and ground units. They called everything but receivers; telemetry radios, modems, uplink radio, 3DR radios. Anyway, anything is possible, I’ll do some research on that. Someone gave me the idea of removing the “TX” wire off the FC to GPS connection so the APM cannot overwrite the settings in the GPS but that did not work either. Loiter was the same. (I had an actual 3D lock, but no data for Hdop or # of Sat. Anyway, I had to try it. I don’t mind taking the copter apart piece by piece to troubleshoot it on the bench if that is what it takes, however, what analytical tools can I use on the bench that can give a conclusive result for working in Loiter Mode? I believe I would need an actual flight for that. The only thing I can think of is having it “on the bench” to troubleshoot is to remove those nasty red boxed Err: GPS-0 and Err: GPS-2 which I get on each and every one of my data logs and the ""rxerrors"" I could put it “on the bench” in a big box where I can bring it outside to get the satellites and simulate the copter armed and running. Separate my high power wires, substitute components, etc and record logs until the those nasty error messages disappears. I don’t think the copter will ever “loiter” with those gps error messages. Any other ideas on bench testing? Graghical tools to use?"

If you can eliminate the GPS errors on the bench or in another copter you should be able to isolate that issue in the current copter. If not, you can start looking for it in the GPS, Compass, FC, RX and wiring on the bench free of the ESCs, motors, PDB, PMU and high current wiring… Once the GPS errors are eliminated, the next step is to address the Loiter jitters. On that note, is your copter’s CG balanced in the center of the FC on both the X & Y axes and in relation to the motor’s lift location?

What’s that, about 150ft up? Great links for PID tunning. I will check in detail later when my loiter dilemma is fixed and is working on all my boards. fahoenack - I believe I know why your Loiter mode is not working on 3.1.2v Seems switching between versions using the standard “Initial Setup” screen in MP planner is not enough. You need to erase and reset the APM. (I found this in one of the forums) You have to erase the eeprom which could still have “some memory” of the old firmware, afterwards. AFTER updating the firmware you want click on the Terminal Tab (CLI) Select correct COM Port, make sure BAUD is set to 115200. Click on the Connect APM tab At the command line… Type “setup” press ENTER Type “reset” press ENTER, Type “Y” and press ENTER You should see the response: Reboot APM Physically press the reset button on the APM board (just hold it down for a sec) It will display ""erasing eeprom"" Done You can press Enter 3 times to stop the screen from scrolling showing all the present parameters if you want. This process is the “clean” way to change to a new firmware update…or downgrade, if you wish By the way, if you are using a older firmware that has Position mode, don’t be afraid to try it if your Loiter mode is working well. It uses the same sensors, calibrations, etc as Loiter mode with the only difference that it doesn’t use the barometer sensor to hold altitude. If “Loiter” works, 'Position"" has to work! I will write a detailed post when I have time to help folks to avoid fly-aways. There is a way in APM to minimize (actually eliminate it, if the APM is setup correctly and you got good GPS signal) fly-aways/crashes by incorporating several failsafes and then TESTING them. Fly-aways should not happen with such a sophisticated flight controller as the AMP2+ or Pixhauk. That’s the whole beauty of it!!!"

My APM boards are perfect and yet they do not “Loiter” I am using the working 3dr boards as platform to trouble shoot the non working boards. Getting close to the solution, it looks it is not the boards themselves but how they communicate with the GPS unit. Will report solution, hopefully soon. And yes, I will be writing the anti-fly-aways solutions soon…it has everything to do with flying in Loiter mode so fits perfect to the thread’s subject."

Below is the “Loiter Performance” graph looking pretty bad, 2 pairs of lines should be practically on top of each other (parallel) *","Not resolved yet but I have some answers I been looking for. The root of the problem is what I suspected; the communication between the GPS and the APM. When using the original GPS ordered from 3drobotics (a Ublox LEA-6H) all my other APM 2.6 boards work perfectly in Loiter mode…actually works in every mode. The moment I try to use a different GPS with the same APM2.6 board, Loiter doesn’t work. I realize when I switch a GPS unit, I also am changing the compass which needs re-calibration; it is not the compasses, they work perfect and are locked in to accuracy of about 1 degree. Using Ublox, I am trying to configure the other Ublox GPS units I have, 2 NEO-6M and 2 LEA-6H to mirror the settings in the original 3DR one. There seems to be a partial block in communication. Cannot configure the gps units via Ublox by uploading a txt file without some error messages and neither by directly using the configuration view. Starting with the original gps unit from 3DR; cannot view its present settings in the configuration view screen. Ublox, however is communicating fine with the all the GPS units as far as receiving all location data. It displays the 3D fix with all the “pretty colorful graphs” working well showing all the satellites it is getting, etc. I believe this is the root of the problem a lot of people are having with their copter not working in Loiter Mode, for this problem is somewhat concealed because this GPS / APM miss-communication will not show on any log/telemetry graph or on live tuning nor will it produce a gps error message in the logs. The data that does show is an excellent hdop, for example, close to 1 and tracking 12 satellites…yet…Loiter will not work. This is tricky because it makes you think everything with the gps unit is fine. First I will try to find if there is a data matrix to where mission planner is reporting this error. Second, I will have to find out how to “see” the exact settings on the 3DR gps and duplicate them on the other gps units. (It’s almost like the unit has this data blocked, but I am hoping this is just my imagination) I need to find out why I can not view and change the actual gps settings using Ublox while everything else works and shows up. Hope to report soon…"

Below is the “Loiter Performance” graph looking pretty bad, 2 pairs of lines should be practically on top of each other (parallel) *","Here are some solutions to help avoid fly-a-ways as it has everything to do with “Loiter Mode””. You have all the technology built into the APM2.5 / 2.6 to avoid fly-a-ways when implemented correctly. These can only be implemented if your “Loiter Mode” is working perfectly. If this mode is not working well you should only fly close and in stabilize mode(if it is stable) and nothing else, or else, you are asking for a fly-a-way!!! I order of sequence… Stabilize mode has to be working well first. The default PID settings will work well for most average weight copters. Sync your ESCs as per manual, check you center of gravity and move the battery and or components on the copter for a well balanced COG front to back and side to side. Do a radio calibration in the mission planner or anything else you can think off to get your copter to stabilize perfectly. Altitude hold is next. It has to be flawless. Copter should stay at the altitude you locked it on to. If windy, it is normal for the copter to fluctuate up or down a couple of feet and you will see it always trying to go back to the correct altitude. If your copter suddenly rises when you engage altitude mode or drops suddenly when you disengage it, it is your barometer. (It will almost seem the whole copter is out of control) It needs to be isolated from air disturbances such as wind, prop turbulence and also against light. Yes light, as in daylight. Place a “breathable” piece of foam upon the barometer chip on board the APM. Check also that this foam is not that see-through in order to block some of the light. If you want to secure it with some hot glue it is up to you. Mine in not. Just placed it carefully directly on top of the barometer and then close the APM plastic case securely on top of it. Make sure it is thick enough that the case squeezes it down a little to secure it in place when the case is closed.  Next is Loiter Mode. Do all the calibrations…compass orientation, radio calibration and magnetic declination(make sure auto dec declination box in (MP) mission planner is checked is all you need for mag declination to be set correctly) and very, very important…compass calibration(x,y,z offsets) Now check Loiter Mode. It should hold the position and altitude very well. If it doesn’t you are having a poor reception of the satellites which is unlikely (if you turn on the copter in opened field and waited 3 to 4 mins) or a bad communication between the GPS unit and the APM board which is very likely.(Still trying to settle this issue here on this thread) For now if you want an immediate fix and you are willing to pay for it, order a GPS module directly from 3D robotics at about 90 bucks. It a lot of $ but there is a very high probability that your Loiter problem will be solved instantly…as it was with mine and many other folks. Enjoy flying and with time, hopefully you will resolve the bad gps communication issue to make your other cheaper gps units work via this thread and/or other sources. Now that stabilize, altitude and loiter flights modes work perfectly you can implement very good fail safes via MP (mission planner) and via your radio/receiver Again, these failsafes work very well but only if the 3 flight modes described above are working as intended. (1) FailSafe 1 - Radio Transmission Set you receiver’s failsafe so that when you turn off the radio your throttle signal goes to to 1000 pwm.(or lower) Check your radio/receiver docs to see how to do this. Then go to MP --> Initial Setup–> FailSafe and by looking at “Radio 3” verify your pwm is going down to 1000 when you turn your radio’s power off. Also check with the radio on, that the pwm does not go much lower than 1100 when you bring the throttle all the way down. Now in this same section of MP under “FailSafe Options” select “Enabled always RTL” and under FS Pwm type 1040 (anything well over 1000 but under 1100) Don’t click anything else; stay on this page of MP for the next failsafe. –Not complete yet, you will set the RTL altitude after reading below, keep going– (2) FailSafe 2 - Battery Check box “Battery Failsafe” and under “Low Battery” type the voltage you want to set the failsafe to. I have mine set to 10.3v (10.5v if you want a little more of a safety net for your lipo) I have “Reserved MAH” set to 0. I found the computer doesn’t correctly interpret how much MAh I have left but with voltage you can’t really go wrong. 10.3v is 10.3v and it means it is time to land!! If you have the 2 modems radios and are using a ground control station to a point that you really need the information on the GCS to navigate or critical info you want to see at all times, you can check the box “GSC FS Enable” If the communication with the GSC is lost, the aircraft will RTF (Return to Launch) Now go to MP --> Config/Tuning–> Full Parameter List and find the setting for “FS_BATT_ENABLE” either by scrolling down and looking for it or click “Find” , type “RTL” and press enter. Then type “2” for the value. To the right of the screen click “Write Param” to save the parameters to the APM board permanently. –Not complete yet, you will set the RTL altitude after reading below, keep going– (3) FailSafe 3 - GeoFence (or Fence) Go to MP --> Config/Tuning–> GeoFence Check the enable box. Select “Altitude and Circle” on Type and “RTL or Land” on Action. Select your maximum altitude and radius which you want to the copter to stay within. Next, the “RTL Altitude” is a very important setup because of how it affects the “Max Radius” failsafe. If you are flying far and only via FPV you need to know your landscape. Meaning, how high your trees, buildings or any object are. If you are in a valley and passed a mountain or in a rural area and just passed a 100 foot tall building, you want to make sure to set your RTL Altitude to MORE than the altitudes of objects so that if your are flying lower than the objects, when that failsafe is triggered and the aircraft is commanded to come back home automatically, it will to fly ABOVE the objects. (It will raise its altitude directly up from where it is (holding its position) say to 200 ft, then fly back at that altitude to its point of launch and decent directly to its launch point in order to land. If you are flying pretty close and/or on a flat field with no obstacles you can set the RTF altitude to “0” It will come back at the altitude your were currently flying. Regarding the Max Altitude, where ever you set your max alt to, the copter will not go any higher even if hold your throttle stick all the way up. (Fence is a pretty cool feature) As an option, in MP --> Config/Tuning–> Extended Tuning under Ch7 or Ch8 Option, you can set the fence feature to be turned on and off via a switch on your radio. IMPORTANT NOTE - keep your eye on what units of measurement MP is using when setting your altitude and radius (meters, feet, centimeters, etc) so you can set it correctly to what you want. (4) RTL Land or Hover Here is how to set the RTL to land or just hover over the launch point when it comes back. Go to MP --> Config/Tuning–> Standard Params. Find the setting for “RTL Final Altitude (RTL_ALT_FINAL)” either by scrolling down and looking for it or click “Find” , type “RTL” and press enter. Set this value to 0 to land when it returns or to 304 for example if you want it to just hover 10 feet over from where you launched it after it came back (GeoFence screen is in feet or meters; here on this screen it is in centimeters so do your calculations) As an option, to exit RTL mode once you feel the aircraft is close enough and you can have complete control over it, change to stabilize mode to regain control. (I just change to Stabilize for a second to exit RTL and immediately to Loiter) The following should already be set by default but just in case check them: Go to MP --> Config/Tuning–> Standard Params and set “Arming check(ARMING_CHECK)” to “Enabled” (6) Go to MP --> Config/Tuning–> Standard Params and set Battery monitoring(BATT_MONITOR) to “Voltage and Current” or at least to “Voltage” You are not done yet, you need to test all these functions in real flight. —Always, always verify your settings and test in real flight– Fly in Loiter mode and make sure position and altitude is holding nice and steady. Now you have to do the hardest thing for a rc pilot to do, it is pretty scary at first but you have to do this if you want to prevent fly-a-ways. In an opened field, fly in Loiter Mode about 40 or 50 feet away at a low altitude and turn the radio off. It will raise straight up to 100ft then fly back to it launch position and slowly decent and land. (Assuming you have you RTL Alt set to 100ft and RTL Final Alt to 0 as explained above) If you move your throttle all the way down(which you can do after it enters RTL mode because it has no effect) after it lands it will also turn the props off!!! Now, lets test the Battery Failsafe. When you are close to the end of your flight, let the copter sit there and hover in loiter mode. When the battery reaches 10.5 or whatever you set it to, it will RTL. Well, test these features out, it will definitely reduce a lot of fly-a-ways!!!"

I was flying before pretty good but now i stuck. first thing was that i had problems connecting with the MAV link. after trying different MP releases it worked somtimes. but now after also reseting my 2.6 board the gps isnt conecting to satelites and the compass stopped working too. there gettin no samples collected. everything seems to be working good actually. the comport and every single lamp is flashing even on the 3dr gps module…so i have no idea where the problem is…please help!..im really scared to update anything when this is working again…thx for answers…if u want to answer in german so feel free,It sounds like there are issues with the most recent MP. 3.1.3 does not differ from 3.1.2 except for a small bug fix. Please downgrade MP and see if the issues go away.

Ciao - Giuseppe","I typically do not re-do the calibration between releases.  This is a bit of a tricky thing, as sometimes you need to, but sometimes you do not.  You really need to pay attention to the releases to know for sure, which I do since I’m a developer. There is no 3.1.5, so I assume you mean 3.1.3.  You should not need to update any parameter or retune anything going from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3.  Just load the new code, maybe have a look through the parameters list to make sure everything looks right, and that’s it. You don’t need to do an erase-reset-retune."

Assuming the Pixhawk and Ublox was working, (Ublox was 10cm or so above everything on an aluminium stalk from the start) it had to be something causing greater than normal mag field. So I checked everything and re-run all the cables to the lowest position possible plus one of the ESC’s had two bullet connectors not in all the way. They connected well but the copper was little bit exposed. Fixed that, re-ran live calibration and Loiter works perfectly albeit a little fidgety. Should I tune down the Loiter PIDs some? Then I went through the compassmot motions  - prop switch, secure chopper, throttle up  etc - without actually running compassmot. There is still a slight variation in heading with the throttle at 75% and the aircraft held down in place. More testing tomorrow."

When you mention “loading the code from master”, I thought the latest release was always delivered by MP in the Install Firmware area?  (Which for me states that Arducopter Quad is at 3.1.2…) Please let me know if I should be getting the latest released firmware from somewhere other than MP.  Thanks! Further, Thanks for your info on diagnosing why auto tune isn’t starting for me - I don’t think I have any radio trim going on and I’m pretty sure I had my sticks in neutral in alt-hold mode when attempting to start the procedure.  I have done both the radio calibration and the accel calibration a few times.  I didn’t realize that there was an auto trim function.  How is the auto trim function executed?  If all of these check out - Is there anything else I can check to see why autotune doesn’t start? Thanks again, Marco"

I zeroed them out on the radio and then performed the auto trim function (arm for 20 seconds - got flashing red and blue on the pixhawk) and flew in stablize for a bit, landed, and disarmed.  Took it up again, and it is nicely trimmed now. I then tried going into alt-hold, hit autotune, and bingo it started doing its dance.  Landed and disarmed.  PIDs got saved.  I’ve never manually tuned anything, so I don’t know what these gain settings do.  Changes are as follows: Stabilized Roll - from 4.5 to 10.5 Stabilized Pitch - from 4.5 to 10.5 Stabilized Yaw - Unchanged at 4.5 Loiter PID - Unchanged at 1.0 Rate Roll P - from .15 to .11 I - from .10 to .11 D - from .004 to .0065 Rate Pitch P - unchanged at .15 I - from .10 to .15 D - from .004 to .008 Rate Yaw P - unchanged at .2 I - unchanged at .2 D - unchanged at .00 Do these numbers make sense?  Quad seems to fly ok - can’t really tell the difference to be honest. Anyway, I wanted to complete my tuning and took jschall’s advice to try to get compassmot working…so I rebuilt the firmware from Master - loaded the new firmware - went into terminal, (firmware reported is 3.1.2 dev) but when I enter the setup command, compassmot is not an available command.  Did I do something wrong in compiling the firmware from the master github repository? Thanks for all you help… Marco"
386,Altitude in Mission Planning,1,"I have a question regarding what altitude to use in mission planning. I hope this makes sense. I’m new to this so if this seems obvious, my apologies. My confusion stems from the use of the ‘Verify Height’ check box and what effect it has on the altitude settings. If the check box is disabled, the altitude settings appear to reflect the altitude above where the copter was armed. In other words, when the copter is armed, that altitude is the 0m mark and any altitude settings in your mission plan are meters above that 0m altitude. Another way of looking at it is that all altitude settings are ‘height above ground level’ assuming your flying field is relatively flat. All of this changes when the ‘Verify Height’ check box is checked. It appears to me that when it is checked, that mission planner begins to use ‘height above sea level’ plus the ‘Default Alt’ setting. At my field, all of the way points I enter default to roughly 290m. I’m concerned that if I leave the ‘verify height’ settings in place that my copter will climb to 290m above ground level. I hope this makes sense. Maybe I should just not use the ‘Verify Height’ since my field is relatively flat, but I was curious how it worked. Thanks, MadSANMan","Yes, your expectation is right.    I’ve never flown it with verify on though.   It’s supposed to use terrain data (google I think) so that you can be sure that you don’t fly into a hill or what ever. But yeah, I’m in a similar boat ~200 feet above sea level, but it’s surprisingly good data as I have some rolling hills and the data seems to know about that. But I am not about to fly a mission built with that data yet becasue I’m pretty sure my 10m setting would actually fly up to 210m and that’s not where I want to be. I had an issue where I had the distance set to meters, but the speed set to feet-per-second, and that cause Mission planner to send ‘feet’ to the device.  So when I thought I’d be at 50meters, I clipped the tops of some 55feet tall trees. So I’m not gonna try it.   I’ll let you go first and report back "
387,Quad rotors run at different speeds,1,"I tried today my new APM for the first time and was rewarded with a rather weird crash. At a closer inspection I noticed that the rotorts turned with different speeds. I removed the propellors and did some experiments. When I start the motors in Stabilize mode on a flat surface one of them starts to gradually turn slower. This can be seen and heard. This behavior can be repeated but it needn’t always be the same motor. I have the impression this does not happen in Loiter mode. I would expect it to be the other way around, if such a behavior should occur at all with a perfectly unmoving quad. The rotors do vary their speed when I turn it and that is to be expected. Somebode any idea what is wrong? Thanks in advance!",Is the quad perfectly level when starting? If it’s on a slope the lowest motor will spin faster attempting to lift that side up. If the ESC’s are calibrated correctly then all the motors should ‘start’ simultaneously.

This way, if I drop throttle to zero, they stop spinning, and 2-3 seconds later, I’m disarmed. If you want advanced failsafe things, like radio failsafe, you can’t just send PWM<900 (or whatever) because that is needed for radio loss. So the only way I know to do it is the above method."

I had toyed with failsafe also and had set my Taranis up to have a custom function on one of the switches (love that Radio system) so that I could force the throttle PWM to < 900, but as mentioned that invokes a failsafe, none of which are “stop motor’s spinning”, possibly quite rightly… I would be in favour of jschall’s initial suggestion of stuffing a channel, say ch8 (as am using channel 7 for RTL right now  ), as a switch between Disarm and “ready to arm”.  This way when flicked down, say, it kills motor outputs (clearly a switch not to touch during normal flying, but I think the pro’s out weight the cons, at least in my case) and then when flicked back up will allow the pix to be rearmed in the normal fashion?  Or perhaps a switch between Disarm and Arm (allowing for immediate recovery should it flicked in flight?)

I don’t land my copter in places I cannot see it If it crashes where I cannot see it, I know that my motors are not spinning if my trottle is zero. I do not want the props to suddenly start spinning on an unexpected arming event. Kids and dogs will still put their fingers into the prop area. Spinning props are somewhat invisible to kids, and toddlers and dogs don’t know that they should not touch it.  The safety switch, LEDs, and audible tones are plenty for me to know with certainty about my arming state, and those enhancements are a huge help to me, who comes from the OP world where there were no tones or easy to see LEDs, so I always assume it’s armed unless I know it’s not."

However the the OP was asking for an obvious solution, and I shared with him my workaround which achieves his goal but in a different manner: “However, I did want to make sure I wasn’t missing some obvious solution to my prob and if there do happen to be existing guides on how to achieve this, please could you point me to them?” Just trying to contribute to the community and this forum. Giving up one safety feature for another is at the pilot’s discretion and based on experince and ordering of priorities. Having a flexible system like AC allows us to have choice, and because we don’t have a “switch”, I had to make a sacrifice to have instant disarm. Should a switch later be assignable for kill, I’d probably use it, but until that happens, my solution is the only one I know of, but by all means, correct me if I’m wrong."

I would be fine with a switch that set to MOT_SPIN_ARMED as then it would be up to the individual whether or not MOT_SPIN_ARMED was subsequently set to 0, which I believe would effectively achieve the ask? It seems arguments can be made for and against having such a switch in play.  Seemingly there is no absolute safety violation against either argument?  Providing that is the case then maybe it could be added with the condition that the feature be configured as “disabled” by default (disabled meaning no different to how things are now).  Then it would be up to the individual to configure to enabled if desired.  Rather like the indivdual has the choice of having MOT_SPIN_ARMED set to 0 or not right now, but by default it is not 0. cheers M"

As MOT_SPIN_ARMED at 0 already achieves the ask when throttle is pulled to min pos. Thus the question of whether an actual disarm/throttle kill switch can be created still stands and in the meantime folks like myself and seemingly brit can continue to use the current mechanism of setting MOT_SPIN_ARMED to 0 to achieve the goal?

I think that may already exist, but let’s stay on topic please to avoid confusion. I support the request for an absolute kill switch.  This sort of thing has existed in the RC Hobby field for a long time.  The idea of an emergency stop also exists in industry.  I think it could be done in this application, with a little bit of extra logic to ensure safe operation. First, define normal state as kill switch “off” and throttle kill as kill switch “up”. So, you cannot do primary arming if kill switch is up.  This prevents somebody accidentally arming in a kill state, raising throttle, wondering why nothing happens, and then dropping the kill switch and having it take off. Once it has been armed with the kill switch off, the motors go to Mot_spin_armed and respond to throttle normally. If the kills switch if flipped “up” at any point, motors go to ZERO.  Not Mot_spin_armed, but zero. If the kill switch is flipped up for 10 seconds, the vehicle disarms automatically.  Nobody is going to tumble a multirotor in throttle kill for 10 seconds and then hope to get it back.  This check would avoid having the operator land and kill the motors with the kill switch, then walk over, and flip the switch down, resulting in the craft unexpectedly taking off again."

The idea is that it’s the last resort for the user to prevent a bird from flying away or flying into people or property in case the FC makes weird decisions. I’m pointing that out because I believe that would require implementation a bit away from the “normal” process chain, maybe in the I/O or just generally on a deeper level. I’m talking really low level here. On a higher level, the crash detection algo or something similar could query the kill switch status and if the vehicle is equipped with a parachute, the kill switch could autotrigger that too. And don’t forget making lots of noise . Some siren tone or an intermittent tone like a truck backup alert to make people aware something is in the air that’s potentially NOT love .

It takes away ambiguity. I added it myself after I got cut up. A kid will run right up and stick his face over a copter that does not have spinning motors, but won’t do the same with a “running” copter.  I’m certainly not trying to revive this debate, but I respecfully disagree, for these reasons:  What I said above about having 100% authority about whether or not the motors are spinning  With Pixhawk, the audible and LED feedback for me makes it clear about what state I’m in I use the safety switch just before takeoff and first thing after landing. I don’t land my copter in places I cannot see it If it crashes where I cannot see it, I know that my motors are not spinning if my trottle is zero. I do not want the props to suddenly start spinning on an unexpected arming event. Kids and dogs will still put their fingers into the prop area. Spinning props are somewhat invisible to kids, and toddlers and dogs don’t know that they should not touch it.  The safety switch, LEDs, and audible tones are plenty for me to know with certainty about my arming state, and those enhancements are a huge help to me, who comes from the OP world where there were no tones or easy to see LEDs, so I always assume it’s armed unless I know it’s not."

It looks like you have to keep pulling back on the stick to try to get it to level out, and it’s not doing a good job. So it might be “flying away” simply because it can’t keep the pitch, so it keeps nosing down, and away from you.  This would also make auto modes behave really badly. Your Rate Pitch Imax is at the default of 500.  I would try increasing that in steps of 500 until it hovers level with your hand off the stick."

I have some theories but I don’t want to sway yours. Any assistance would be appreciated.","Just go into the PID tuning screen and increase the Rate Imax to 1000, then 1500, etc. if you need more."
392,Change the 'arm' from rudder to aileron/roll,1,"Hi all, I have a tricopter that I’ve recently assembled and starting to tune.  The problem I’m having is when arming/disarming the tilt on the tail servo puts the blades into the ground.    While I can increase the height from the ground or put limits in place for this servo, Is there an option to change the channel used to arm the apm ?

Thanks Jason.’","I had a somewhat similar problem in that my servo travel on my tricopter is limited and I didn’t want my servo hitting hard against the stops. I dealt with it by adjusting my RC transmitter to limit the range of travel of the servo channel. One catch to be aware of. In order to arm the throttle the yaw PPM must be greater than a certain value. If you limit the yaw PPM range too much it won’t arm as the PPM signal will be too low. I found the allowable values deep in the APM code at one time, but I can’t seem to find them again at the moment. I apologize for that.  Just be aware that if you do limit your RC transmitter’s servo travel, and it won’t arm, you need to increase the travel range until it does. EDIT: Found it!  It’s in motors.pde. For the copter to arm the rc channel must be between 1300 and 1700. So you can adjust the limits on your RC transmitter, limiting your throw, just don’t go below 1300 or above 1700. Worked for me."
393,DX8 for auto tune,1,I’d like to try auto tune but can’t figure out how the CH7/8 setup works.

The problem is solved now. The fault was a faulty Magnetometer from 3DR. (The seems that the faulty magnetometer tells the apm 2.5 that it is north all the time. If you rotate the quad fast about about a qauter turn, the compass reading will show 45deg yaw for a split second and then slowly return to north. If I turn the quad south it will also say north.) I did not see this fault at first because I always put the quad pointing north and the see if the compass is lined up with north as well. I replaced the Magnetometer with a spare one that was supposed to go on another quad. I will test the loiter, rtl and auto this weekend."

If the board is backwards, the APM will think it is flipping in the opposite direction and magnify the flip.  You would need to change AHRS Orientation parameter. It could be that your motors aren’t connected to the right inputs.  Double check this to be sure. As always, logs of the problem would really help."

I have a octo X-8 config on a tarrot ironman frame, and am having this problem, but I also have a spider frame that I just did and was having the same issue. I spent all night and day going through the programming and found the issue.  I am running the latest FM version and set the prams for beginner. it pitches forward on take off, so if you start off slow it will just do its flip. Keep in mind it does have a brushless gimbal on the front with a go pro.  The rear is set with a 3300 mha 11.1 3s. So what I have found is, that unless the auto trim has been done it will have these issues. Starting off slow makes it just tilt forward, I have to pitch back to get it up and stable. I will be doing an auto trim sequence in a little while and will see how she goes, but, all in all she is flying.  I did the motor test in terminal mode, just making sure the orentation of the motors were correct, and that goes just fine although I did notice something. Reading through the wiki it says that it will start with the first front right motor and work its way clockwise. But with mine, it starts at the first rear left and works clockwise. Not sure if this is an issue but I spent today switching up motor orientation to see if it would do motor one first, then 4, then 2 then 3 then end at 1. But no go. It starts at motor 2, then goes to 3, then 1 then 4. (Shrugs) not sure why. (This is a x config btw) I am not running older firmware and got the issue sorted, I think. I will update here with some video in a couple of hours as I am in the lab with both the aircraft all night tonight. Any other input would be greatly appreciated. (Ps.) I will upload the logs from the flight testing and would GREATLY appreciate any advice on extra tweeking and setting. )  Cheers!"

Off the top of my head, I am going to guess that your airframe CG is not balanced front to back, due to the camera and gimbal on the front.  Then, I’m going to guess that your Rate Pitch Imax is still set at the default of 500.  Try increasing it in 500 point steps until the craft flies level.  You may always get some amount of initial tipping on lift-off until the controller can compensate for the CG offset, but it should not flip."

Switching off simple mode would eliminate magnetometer compensation, it does make sense but it didn’t seem to affect the problem in any way.

Battery was at 64% (Damn minimOSD config, accidently set it to % instead of mah on last update)   Minim OSD had battery low message on screen but that was due to voltage dropping under load   GPS sats were 10   0 to 3 km/h forward speed   The hex started quickly from a yawing hover at 0 vertical speed to -230 Meters/minute.   With my Pan/Tilt camera I looked over at one of the motors and it was turning at a good speed (or I would have dropped like a rock lol).   Just before I “landed” I switched into Stab mode to try to recovery but it did not respond even to max throttle.  Though it did seem to let me cushion the landing as the Vertical speed dropped (or rose actually) to -30 ish.   Once on ground I cut throttle.   I switched into AltH mode (likely by accident lol) and throttled up and climbed again and flew back home without issue.   EDIT: I see that Randy has posted an update to Github: ArduCopter 3.1.3 7-Apr-2014 Changes from 3.1.2  Stability patch fix which could cause motors to go to min at full throttle and with large roll/pitch inputs  Sounds very related.",Here is the APM log.  You can see just after the 6 min mark the rapid decent.   Throttle In and Throttle Out are high so that is strange (until I chop it when on the ground). The errors at the end was due to a crash (damn tree branch) which unplugged the GPS. However in the area of the decent I don’t see anything that jumps out at me.

400,Prearm: RC not calibrated,1,"Hi, I just got all parts to build my first quadcopter (so of course I am a newbie ). I have a DJI F450 kit (with motors and ESCs), a pixhawk, 3DR GPS+compass and 3DR PPM sum encoder (v3). Radio is a Spektrum DX6i with a AR6210 receiver incl. satellite (that is why I am using the PPM sum encoder). In the meantime the frame is ready, motors and ESCs mounted. So I connected the Pixhawk, flashed the firmware with MissionPlanner (v3.1.2) and also completed the wizard for first time setup. But I cannot arm the quad, if prearm checks are enabled. It says RC not calibrated, despite the fact that I calibrated it several times. From another post I learned that min/max values could be the problem, but I do not know how to fix it. Here are the calibration values: Ch1: 1600-3007 Ch2: 1000-1403 Ch3: 991-1412 Ch4: 1600-2006 Ch5: 991-1413 Ch6: 1592-2014 The ranges seem a bit strange? In addition - if I deactivate prearm check RC - and arm the device, 2 motors do not spin even if I set throttle to max. Should not spin all motors even at low throttle? I would appreciate any help! Thanks!","In the meantime I did some experiments and found out that the problem arises from the PPM encoder. If I connect the satellite directly to the pixhawk everything is fine. I am able to calibrate the RC and also the motors spin as expected  However, I like to use the main receiver (increased range). But I’ll move that question to the appropriate section."

This may result in a much quicker landing than you were anticipating. If the quad doesn’t have a sensor to determine where the ground is, then it can’t make any other decision beyond assuming the ground is the same height it was when it took off. In a case like that I would switch to AltHold or Stabilize and land manually, OR set a very conservative speed for WPNAV_SPEED_DN which would allow for an acceptable landing (maybe not graceful, but survivable)."

I assume that’s whet you mean by bounce? I would prefer it just stops there until you turn it around to bring it back rather than it switches into RTL. Alternatively have it so it has a time frame that it stops there for say 1 min and if you haven’t changed its flight patch to come back from the Geofence, only then switch it to RLT. . Point 2, Others will correct me if I am wrong, but I think position hold is no longer needed and its been substituted with Loiter which is achieving the same thing. On your last point, I don’t like spin on arm either and have it disabled. But I can see some of the reasoning behind it and particularly for newbies. * *"

Pausing allows the inertial nav altitude and the baro altitude estimates to align so that we can continue the decent to the ground at a very controlled rate. As the vehicle flies through the air, the local air pressure drops (Bernoulli principle). How much the pressure changes depends on how fast the vehicle has been travelling and the specific geometry of your particular air frame.  If you look in your logs at the baro alt and the inertial alt you can adjust the RTL_LOIT_TIME if they are converging faster than the default time."

Try the following: Place the Quad at 12-15m and initiate LAND mode. It will descent to 10 m and wait there. Try to force it to descent via Throttle. Won’t work, which is imho bad. Wait and see how it will take until your Quad starts the descent from 10m. @Craig3DR: I do understand the necessity of loitering in a RTL case or even in the case that LAND was called as part of an autonomous flight. But in case LAND was triggered by a failsafe, I would argue that “speed to ground” beats “very controlled decent rate”. Maybe we need a special FS_LAND mode that differs from LAND mode used in autonomous flight. Also a few questions that remain open:  Does RTL_LOIT_TIME also apply to the loiter time in LAND mode? Why is the loiter time of LAND mode not documented?  And while in altitude loiter  - whether RTL or LAND - I would also argue that one should still be able to initiate a manual decent and thus override Arducopter without having to do a mode switch. I get a bad feeling when the operator is “overriden” by an automatism."

I’m not sure about Land mode, but I know this has caused me problems on RTL.  It wants to make sure you hit the RTL waypoint precisely before it begins the land.  And if it’s moving around a bit, it won’t be satisfied, and will keep trying to get that target point.  This causes an non-deterministic delay on the RTL landing. So, you could try opening up the WP Radius parameter a little bit."

You should be able to look at what value the APM is getting from the receiver so make sure that the value you get with the TX on and the APM and RX plugged in is the same as the midpoint value.

408,RTL Throttle Oscillations (With flight logs),1,"We had an unusual problem while flight testing our hexacopter and can’t quite decide on the cause of the problem.  We’re hoping some of you pros out there might look this over and make some suggestions. Our system is APM2.6 running FW version 3.1.2.  It is on a DJI S800 hexacopter frame. Long Story: We powered and armed the hex on the worktable to ensure the ESC calibration took.  Then we disarmed it and without disconnecting the battery we moved it to the launch site.  We got a dialog box that stated that the home position failed to update, and because we were outside our established geofence (with home at the worktable), the device went into immediate failsafe and RTL.  Its still sitting on the ground because we hadn’t throttled yet.  However the attempts to disable it with the RCTx didn’t work (at the time we didn’t know it was in RTL).  Mistakenly, the pilot blipped the throttle which initiated RTL and the hexacopter powered up suddenly and began its ascent to the 30 meter target alt for RTL. We understand that much of it.  The problem we don’t understand is that on the way up and on the way down, the throttle out value was pulsing, causing the motors to pulse.  About 1/2 Hz.  Up down, up down, sometimes to maximum throttle out.  This caused an oscillation in altitude for the entire flight.  After it hit its 30 meter mark, it started a descent, which was smoother but not perfect.  When it touched the ground it immediately jumped back up to 10 meters.  2nd time it touched down it jumped back up again.  This time it started wobbling and came down hard enough to pop the battery off, thus ending the flight (and breaking two arm joints) We can’t decide exactly what happened.  We did notice that the targetAlt value on the HUD is jumping around like crazy, up and down.  We noticed that the barometer altitude shows negative several times in the beginning and has large jumps during the in-flight oscillations (17 meter jumps, whereas the vehicle itself did not seem to be jumping that much).  There is disagreement among us whether the barometer is  causing the problem or not.  We are just not sure. What would cause the large jumps in target Alt?  That seems like it should be set to 30 meters during the ascent and 10 meters ( and then land) on the descent.   We did note that the RCTx throttle stick was at zero most of the time.

Sorry for the really long explanation.   Hopefully someone can help! Thanks in advance!","I should also state that we have a 3D printed dome over the APM (which is outside its plastic case) to protect the barometer from sunlight and the rest of the system from light rain. Furthermore, the next day we flew an identical aircraft (System #2) with geofence disabled and had no problems.  The only difference is a small piece of foam on the 2nd aircraft over the barometer that is not on the first.  We noticed a small improvement in altitude hold on the 2nd aircraft when we placed the foam.  I am skeptical that the lack of foam was causing such wild, rapid oscillations in the first system during this event though.  There was no such wild oscillation in the 2nd aircraft before the foam was placed. Again, sorry for all the details.  Never know what is important!"

Sorry for the really long explanation.   Hopefully someone can help! Thanks in advance!","Thank you for your quick response.  It is very much appreciated. Respectfully, while we believe that the vibrations may have contributed to the problem, we do not think they caused the problem.  There are several reasons we think this:  The same system has flown before with no problems.  The only difference is that we swapped out the APM for a new one (same HW version, update version from 3.0.2 to 3.1.2).  Before the APM swap, the vehicle behaved very well. Likewise, the 2nd system is identical in every way, and it flies “rock solid” (with FW 3.1.2).   We pulled logs off the 2nd aircraft while it was hovering and, to our eyes, looks very much the same. The system is damped on rubber dampers, between the electronics board and the frame, and the frame is isolated from the motors with more rubber dampers. After the hex reached its RTL altitude, it began its descent.  The descent was much smoother than the ascent.  During this period, if you analyze the vibration profile, it appears to be within the tolerances listed in the wiki.  I agree that we might be able to improve it, but I think that the vibration is less the problem, and there was something else causing the issue.  Nor does the vibration explain the wild swings in the barometer that we recorded.  The aircraft was never ascending/descending by over 10 meters in any of its oscillations, which the barometer output suggests. While we recognize that the GPS sample rate and vertical resolution are very low and therefore likely not going to give us a perfect recreation of the flight, it should still show altitude changes of between 10 and 17 meters as the barometer does.  It would appear to us as though the barometer is actually the main fault in the system. Our target_alt displayed on the HUD was bouncing around at about the rate of the oscillations.  I can’t find “targetAlt” in the logs for graphing, but if you replay the mission, you can see it bouncing around on the HUD replay.  How is that figure calculated?  How is it used? Also, something I’ve experienced on my own hex before is that if I throttle really hard and switch over into alt-hold within a couple seconds after take-off, the APM has a difficult time finding the right throttle at which to hover, and oscillations occurred.  Never as bad as our experience last Wednesday, but definitely oscillating.  If I fly in stabilize for a dozen seconds or so, before switching to alt-hold, the vehicle never oscillates.  Does the APM take time to “learn” the throttle setting required for hover?  Seems like the throttle PIDs should be able to stabilize faster than that, and under most conditions it performs really well.  But in the case where I throttle hard on takeoff and switch immediately to ALT-HOLD, it causes instability in altitude.  I wonder if the same problem occurred here, where we accidentally took off in RTL, which ramped the motors up very quickly and accelerated up very fast.  Maybe the APM just didn’t have time to lock into a good throttle setting before being required to control the throttle settings, and if the barometer was misreading and the vibrations added to the problem…? Any thoughts? Again thank you for your response.  We appreciate any thoughts you have."

It would not hold altitude in  AltHold or Loiter. It moved up and down 10 meters or more. Logs showed heavy Z axis vibration, like yours. I tried everything I could think of to damp it out, including a double layer of Zeal tape. The motors and props were well balanced and high quality. I had never seen such bad altitude holding before, and the copter was essentially useless to me for photography. To my eyes there was no visible vibration. Before I put it on a shelf and built a new frame, I thought it would be interesting to try 14"" props. To my surprise it flew rock solid, with very low vibes. Apparently the 16"" props were setting up some sort of unexpected resonance with the frame. So I lose a minute or two flight time with the smaller props, but it now flies great. My point is vibrations can occur from unexpected places. Your log is showing unacceptable Z axis vibration. You mention you changed out the APM, so perhaps there’s something flaky with that unit, or something is resonating inside it. Whatever the cause, your APM thinks it’s vibrating, and if it thinks that you will have terrible altitude holding. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful than that."

I don’t think this is a APM firmware thing. PPM is ~ 1000us to 2000us and invering is done on the ppm generating side, as far I understand this. so the solutions is to change inverted / not-inverted on the transmitter. you can do this for each channel seperately on most transmitters. just check this in radio calibration screen and you should be fine: roll channel decrease is “roll left”, increase “roll right”. pitch decrease is “nose up / pitch back”, increase is “nose down / pitch back”. rudder decrease is yaw left, increase yaw right."

Once we are at the altitude we desire we can bring the throttle near center and the copter should hold that altitude. As for Loiter remember that it depends on GPS lock and the accuracy will vary from times to times so it will not be perfect and wind also plays a significant part in stability. Try and find the sweetspot with the Throttle and it should hold. I used to have that same problem as well until I realised how it should work. Maurice

This will curve your throttle stick during stabilize mode such that mid throttle is 82%. I would caution you to reduce weight or increase power to get margin. Your X650 hovers at probably 65-66% throttle. I suggest you set THR_MID to 650. Note that differing flight conditions (battery voltage, air density, etc) will cause the ideal value of this parameter to change over time. Ballpark it. The transitions from loiter to stabilize will never be perfect. You need to center your throttle during loiter if you want it to maintain altitude. If you’re off-center and out of the (10%, I think?) deadzone, you will climb or descend. By the way, no need to post screenshots, only logs."

These measure acceleration and are used to provide high-frequency motion data. They can be wrecked by vibration. GPS. This measures absolute position. If you’re getting drift over longer periods, this is the problem. Not a lot we can do here, the UBLOX is the best GPS we can get, but it isn’t perfect. Keep sources of RFI away from it. Compass. The measurement of heading from the compass is used twice:   to rotate the accelerometer data into the same frame as the GPS, so that it may be used to provide data at higher rates than the 5hz that the GPS gives us. to rotate the demanded tilt angle from the earth frame into the body frame so that the copter moves in the right direction Compass is interfered with by: High-current DC wires nearby. ESC wires, power distribution boards, etc. You should keep the compass as clear as possible from these sources of interference, and you should also run the CompassMot procedure (which you haven’t done on either copter), during which APM computes a linear relationship between current draw or throttle and compass offsets. Magnetic material on-board the copter. This is corrected for by your offsets. Non-magnetic materials with high magnetic permeability on-board the copter. A piece of nickel or steel. These distort magnetic fields and we don’t correct for them because they’re a small source of error. Just make sure there aren’t any big hunks of steel near the compass.   Roll and pitch tracking. If the roll and pitch aren’t tracking the command well, then the thing won’t be able to hold a good position. The best way to solve this is to do autotune. Do the autotune with the copter loaded lighter than normal and with no stabilizing gimbals present. "

Nothing definitive though. I’ve noted that the more flexible the tail boom is, the greater the wobble. On my first APM tri, I stiffened the tail boom with thin sheets of G10 fiberglass, and the wobble went away. I then added much larger props, and it returned. I’ve also found there’s a definite limit as to how much you can do with PID tuning. The wobble really shows up when graphing Yaw versus NavYaw. The oscillations show up as sinusoidal waves in the Yaw, going above and below the NavYaw. This looks to me like overshoot, so increasing Yaw P or I shouldn’t help much. I did get some improvement by increasing Yaw D, which cuts down the overshoot. But you have to be cautious about too much D. An alternative you might consider to mounting the tail prop upside down is just mount it lower. If you could get the CG of the motor/prop system lower, in line with the centerline of the tail boom, then it would be pivoting around the boom and shouldn’t induce lateral motion. I would guess this would require some sort of mechanism built under the boom. It is odd that none of this happens with a KK2 board."

I think part of the problem, and we have the same issue on helicopters, is that the Nav_Yaw is almost too rigid.  You’ll always have some small angle error, because the yaw rate can never stop instantly.  But the controller wants it to. Most simple systems, if you yaw, and then you tell it to stop, it will stop, and it doesn’t really care where it stopped.  If you wanted it to stop at 15° North, and it stops at 17°N, it’s fine with that.  It will just sit there.  This is how standard heli gyros work, and it’s probably how the more simple flight controllers work.  But our controller says “Nope, you need to be at 15°, get back there!”.  So it sends it the other way, then tries to stop at 15°.  But again, because of the servo lag, etc, it stops at 13°.  So again, the controller sends it back… The only thing you can do is sharpen up the PID, so that it stops super fast, to reduce the overshoot.  But eventually you run up to the stability limits of the PID. I found that FeedForward helped helicopters.  But it’s still not perfect. What happens if you guys set Yaw I to zero?  Does the wagging stop?  It might get slopier in other ways, but does the wagging stop?  If yes, then I suspect FeedForward will help. Multirotors don’t suffer the same effect in yaw, because they use motor torque to create yaw, and the motor torque response is virtually instantaneous.  Much faster than a servo.  They don’t have as much bulk yaw authority or power, but they are more responsive.  So when yaw, and then trying to stop, you’ll usually get one bounce-back, but then it stops precisely."

I found that the wobbling seemed to stop when I brought the P value down to the 1 - 2 range (default is 4.5). I believe the directional lock won’t be as solid now, but I’ll test it more when I get the next chance and when it’s less windy. Rob: Helicopters don’t have to shift masses around in order to change the yaw direction, so in that respect they are quite different to tricopters. The mass of the each motor and prop is significant compared to the rest of the tricopter frame which is a simply a lightweight Y made of sticks. If I were to put the tricopter on the ground, and connect the yaw servo to a servo tester and just move it in one direction, the tricopter will shift in the opposite direction, and shake on it’s landing gear. That’s an unwanted side effect that the firmware is going to notice and react to in flight. Perhaps lowering yaw stabilize P is the key and the main factor that causes the effect you describe in your 3rd paragraph, but I’m not sure, since the documentation is too brief on this. If it is, then that’s nice to know, and perhaps it can be optimized, specially for tricopers, so that yaw stabilize P is dynamically decreased towards 0 or some fraction of it’s normal value if the yaw deviation is within a certain tolerance.  I hope you can follow me on that. So what it should effectively do for example is: if the tricopter yawed 10 degrees too far, then use normal yaw stabilize P to correct it as it is currently done, but if the tricopter yawed only 1 degree too far, lower the weight of yaw stabilize P to say a 1/4 of it’s set value so that the tricopter is very slowly and gently moved to the wanted yaw direction. I don’t know how difficult that behavior would be to code. I think MultiWii uses a similar idea in it’s horizon mode. It’s a mode that’s like stabilize, but when the sticks are moved to extremes, then the stabilizing/leveling effect is dropped and it becomes acro. Or so I’ve heard."

In the past, I’ve also played around with the Stab Yaw P, and was running it at 2.0…  It also just felt better to me. But there’s a problem you should be aware of.  The Stabilize R/P/Y PIDs run in “earth frame”, while the Rate PIDS run in “body frame”.  So, let’s just say as a point of discussion, you have Stab R and P at 4.0, and Stab Yaw of 2.  It’s great in a hover.  But if you have it rolled over 45°, the body-frame yaw Stab is no longer 2.0.  It’s actually between 2.0 and 4.0.  I hope you can see this in your head… I’m not sure how to explain it better in words. So what happens is, you have things tuned well in a hover, but then if you roll it over (or pitch it up), you can get a yaw oscillation.  What needs to happen, and I think Leonard talked about this, was converted the Stab R/P/Y terms to body-frame before using them. Now just think… I have this exact same issue on helis in roll and pitch as well.  And I’m still trying to figure out the ultimate solution. Again, this is really interesting.  About 1-2 years ago, I actually experimented with a “deadband” on yaw, where, if the error was <5°, the stabilize controller would not push the rate controller.  So as long as it stopped in that window, rate wouldn’t be poked back and forth.  It seemed to work, but got lost somewhere in the shuffle."

And a possible suggested fix (with new code) is to create a nonlinear Stabilize Yaw P that is coupled to the roll/pitch values? If I’m understanding you right, that would certainly be a good fix. But I wonder if it’s really necessary for most usage? For me the wobble is annoying only when hovering or moving slowly forward, and doing video or other imaging. This apparent Stabilize Yaw P fix would take care of that, wouldn’t it? For more, um…enthusiastic attitudes, then not so much. But I wouldn’t be doing video with a tricopter for that, I’d use something else. My only concern here, and Rob you might know this, is there any downside lurking out there to lowering the Stabilize Yaw P to a very low value? Is there some flight situation that will get worse due to the Low P value? Of course if there is, I will likely find it."
415,Tricopter yaw wagging issue (firmware 2.* through 3.1.2),13,"I’ve been having this issue for about a year now, and as of yet, haven’t found a solution. To start with, here is a video displaying the wagging yaw issue: * This yaw wagging only occurs with a top mounted yaw mechanism. I’m sure it’s got everything to do with the mass of the yaw mechanism initially moving the tail in the opposite direction of where the controller wants it to go. Simply mounting the mechanism upside down ‘solves’ this issue since the mass of the mechanism helps move the tail in the direction the controller wants it to move. I’ve tested this with Arducopter 2.9.1b and 3.1.2 firmware. I’ve also swapped servos in order to reduce internal servo gear slop as much as possible. When I used the KK2 board on this tricopter, it did not have this wagging issue. The only downside to using a bottom mounted yaw mechanism is the much increased chance of prop strikes, especially when landing hard, or in rough terrain or braking for a landing. So I really hope this issue can be fixed or that someone can lead me in the right direction. Want logs? Just tell me what you want logged and I’ll let the tricopter wag for you.","Actually, the easiest way to visualize the EF-BF rotation issue is this.  Imagine you roll the aircraft 90°.  Now the Stab Pitch P actually controls the Body-Frame Yaw, and the Stab Yaw P actually controls the BF-pitch.  The fix is to rotate the BF Stab numbers to the EF before calculating the error compensation from the outer stab loop.  I think Leonard said he wanted to do this, or something like it. What I was suggesting with dead-band is something else entirely.  This would help the straight-hovering problem where the yaw bounces back and forth endlessly because the servo always lags the command response.  The proper solution would be an adaptive flight control that actually understands how the system behaves, it would understand servo lag, and compensate for it.  But that’s probably a long way off. I flew with Stab P at 2 (in all axes) quite a bit, and didn’t have a problem, but that was on a heli which is more aerodynamically stable."

About 18 batteries…  It definitely seems to do better with StabYawP=2 rather than 6.  I’m not quite sure why yet. The same is true of Stab Pitch and Roll P.

Flies well with my former APM settings - Loiter is really solid.  I’ll see if I can tune down the Yaw as I still see some shake. The yaw wag really only caused issues when using my Mobius camera.  Not bad but some shake back and forth.  With the Pixhawk build I also added the yaw axis to my gimbal.  It’s fixed now - no wag in the video.  Only minus is the extra weight of the 3rd motor which cuts down some on flight time. Very soon - I’ll try autotune on this new frame then play with the yaw and see what happens

For example, Stabilize Roll and Stabilize Pitch P-values typically run 4.5. Yet Loiter speed values typically run around 0.2-0.4. But for the Rate Roll and Rate Pitch P-values, numbers in the 0.1-0.2 range are used. And yet for the Rate Loiter P-value, a number like 5.0 is used. Which of these values would you tweak to make the copter more responsive in loiter mode?"

Thanks in advance, Brian","* * The gain comparisons you are making are not remotely analogous. The units of rate roll and pitch are arbitrary, they depend on the motors’ power output and positions. The loiter rate gain, on the other hand, produces an acceleration demand in m/s/s from a rate error in m/s - how high you can tune it depends only on how rapidly your copter responds to angle demands - it is set to a reasonable value and it probably shouldn’t be touched by users at all. Stabilize P is the same way. It produces an angular rate demand in degrees/s from an angle error in degrees. The way loiter works, you are basically flying a simulation and the copter is following that simulation. Currently, the way the simulation works wrt drag and acceleration makes loiter quite soft. The tuning parameter that affects this is the WPNAV_LOIT_SPEED parameter. Currently the way loiter works will actually decrease the simulated drag as you increase the LOIT_SPEED, which will turn your copter into a freight train (it won’t stop as fast) Loiter is the most difficult mode to get right. Currently, it is not right and at least some of the devs are aware of that. It may or may not be fixed in the next release."

420,Can't Get Y6 to Land on RTL or with Land command in MP,1,"Hi all! I’ve recently completed my Y6 and have been having a great time with it.  It flies amazing.  All the PIDs are stock.  I took it to the beach several days ago a flew a few missions with RTL after a few waypoints and it came back and landed perfectly.  I did this at home as well.  I used the RTL = 0 to get it to land as the final waypoint in the mission. Last night when I got home, I added my GoPro and the OSD devices, so I put a little more weight on the Y6.  I flew it with the identical mission by loading the saved waypoints from the previous successful mission. For some reason, I CAN NOT get the copter to land now.

It’s been reported and it’s high on the list to fix for AC3.2…but basically when it’s doing the LAND it first comes down to 10m above home, then it descends to the ground using the LAND_SPEED.  What can happen though is it can get stuck at this 10m transition point.  We haven’t actually totally figured out why it happens (it shouldn’t happen really).  Normally if you leave it long enough it will eventually break through the 10m barrier. Because we’re not totally sure on the cause I can only guess how to fix it…but maybe increasing the Throttle Accel IMAX value to 10 (default is 5).  Increasing the Altitude Hold P to 1.5 (default is 1.0) may also help. You’ll also probably find that if the copter is below 10m when LAND starts it won’t have this problem…so if you generally fly low you could set the RTL_ALT to 9m or if it’s during a mission put a waypoint above home at 9m before the LAND command.

An interesting thing happened though, I removed the extra LiPo battery for the OSD and also the GoPro to see if I could get the copter to land.  Sure enough it did.

We found that if we set the RTL final altitude to 5 meters (rather than 0), letting it come down to loiter at 5 meters, and then commanding the land mode from mission planner, the vehicle would perform auto-land flawlessly every time.  Furthermore we quickly realized the advantage of doing this, as it gave us the opportunity to ensure that the area under the vehicle was clear and that it was going to land where we wanted it to before commanding the land function.   This does require making “land” one of the modes on your RCTx mode switch, or bring mission planner with you in the field, but I think that it is worth doing it this way anyway."
421,Reversed pitch channel,1,"Today I was flying firs time with my hexacopter. I dont understand one thing. Pitch channel was well calibrated (stick up for max signal, stick lowered for min signal) but when I was flying, backward and forward was reversed! I had to manualy reverse channel in my transmitter for normaly flight. Its normal in arducopter?","It is not at all unusual for any R/C model to have reversed channels when first set up. One of the first things pretty much any experienced RC pilot will do just before launching a new model is check for proper control directions. On an airplane or a traditional heli this can be done visually, On a multicopter it’s not quite that easy. I do it by spooling up to a point where the multi is light on its feet, just barely still staying on the ground or just barely clear of it  (a smooth surface is very helpful here).  From there, gently try each of the three directional controls.  The multi will be bouncing around a bit because of turbulence close to the ground, and balance on a new machine may also be off, not to mention wind, so don’t mistake any of that for reversed controls. If any axis (pitch, roll, yaw) is reversed, simply cut the throttle.  It’s pretty easy to tell.  Now, there may be a temptation to quickly reverse the offending control(s) on the Tx and relaunch, but it’s always safer to disconnect the muti’s battery before doing that and then start over."

427,Can I Connect my APM_Planner to my local ArduPilot in Ubuntu,1,"Hi guys, I’m newbie to this technology   .

The data you see coming from the Pixhawk in the Terminal Window is MavLink data as the Pixhawk is not in the CLI mode. You might try hitting “Enter” three times to see if you can get the Pixhawk into the CLI mode when you see that data stream. You need to have the Pixhawk in the CLI mode to be able to download the data flash logs. The tlogs are sent to your PC over the USB or the telemetry radio anytime the Pixhawk is running. The data flash logs when using MP are stored in the Mission Planner Program Folder. The data flash logs are stored on the Pixhawk micro SD card. You can remove the micro SD card and download the data flash logs to your PC and make them available here for troubleshooting. Regards, TCIII GM"

433,Copter rises rapidly Yaw,1,I let the copter turn on the spot quickly it rises very quickly 2-5 meters. what can I do?,Yaw-throttle coupling is caused by a number of effects:  Motors are capable of accelerating the prop much faster than drag is capable of decelerating the prop. Throttle response is non-linear. We correct for this with the MOT_TCRV parameters. A very overpowered copter might be hovering so close to min throttle that the stability code raises the throttle in order to meet the yaw demand.  It sounds like your motors could be more non-linear than others. You could try tuning your MOT_TCRV parameters. This would be most effective if you had a way of making the measurements that it wants.
433,Copter rises rapidly Yaw,2,I let the copter turn on the spot quickly it rises very quickly 2-5 meters. what can I do?,"After looking at your log, I suspect it could be the stability code causing the rise on yaw.

If it displays “Calibration Failed” (or something to that effect) on the Accel Calibration screen or on the HUD (the artificial horizon) on the Flight Data screen then it’s a problem with the calibration.  If you’re not seeing that then it’s a communication problem. It may be that there are extra characters being sent from the mission planner to the APM and that’s making it think that it should move onto the next stage of the calibration procedure before it’s ready.  If this is the case it may be the USB cable (as suggested above).  You might also try going into the CLI (terminal window in the mission planner), press Connect, then enter “setup” and “accel”.  Then follow the regular procedure of pushing a key and changing the position of the vehicle."

Thankyou","ozyfly, If it says “Calibration Failed” which I think is what you’re saying then it’s most likely that the accelerometers are out-of-tolerance which basically means that they’re leaning on the board or they’re broken.  Normally if you use the CLI (aka mission planner’s terminal window) it will print a little message with the results which could be NaN or some numbers that show that it’s out of tolerance.  could you post a screen shot of what it says at the end of the calibration? I strongly suspect now that it’s not a USB cable issue.  If it’s just barely out of tolerance then we could provide a modified firmware with a slightly wider tolerance…or if it’s a 3dr board you could probably get a replacement."

438,Accelerometer will not calibrate,8,"Good evening, I am new to the scene and on a steep learning curve. I would be most grateful for assistance in addressing my current hitch.

On line 44898 you lost your ground control station’s telemetry signal. That gave you your 2-2 error code. On the next line, 44899, RTL is invoked. In your parameter file, your FS_GCS_ENABLE is set to 0, which is disabled. I suspect you need to set it to 2, which is “Enabled Continue with Mission in Auto Mode”. You did have your FS_THR_ENABLE set to 2, which is also continue the mission, but that’s only for a loss of the throttle signal (which you did lose quite a number of times, BTW).  I would think having the FS_GCS_ENABLE set to disable wouldn’t have been a problem, but it looks like that’s the case if you are using a ground station.

I am seeing a RADIO ERROR [approx 17:45] which I am not sure if its the 3DR Radio or the transmitter being referenced. Thanks, Maurice",Thanks Otherhand I actually figured it out last night and went through the WIKI. The behaviour of the FAILSAFE is as documented. I had it set to continue Mission and it did just that. I was doing some further tests and realised that if FAILSAFE is disabled then if there is a signal loss the error is not logged. It would be useful if there was an option to log these events even if no action is taken so that one could analyse these errors before deciding if a FAILSAFE should be enabled and therefore what appropriate action.

Thanks, Maurice","I am fairly new to APM, but you should be able to see signal loss by looking at THR_In and THR_out. They should track each other fairly well. A sudden drop to a very low PWM value (or to the PWM value you set on your Tx/Rx failsafe) or change in your THR_in would indicate a throttle failsafe, and is how you can see the event if you suspect it might have happened."

444,Has PixHawk (analog) RSSI been implemented?,1,"I’d like to replace my APM with my PixHawk on my quadcopter, but before I do it, I need to know if (analog) RSSI has been implemented yet? If not, then I’ll just keep in on the shelf for the time being. I’ve read scattered messages that PWM RSSI has not been implemented yet, but nothing about analog RSSI. Thanks",I thought this was an easy question. I tested PixHawk with the 3.1.2 firmware and analog RSSI connected but Mission Planner displays no rxrssi. I also set RSSI_PIN to 103 in the full parameters list. Edit:  found the rxrssi is being displayed in the “Status” tab. That’s weird. I saw a screenshot of someone elses MP where it was displayed in the artificial horizon window.

445,V3.1.2 Throttle signal issue,1,"I have a newly built hexacopter that I am using the Pixhawk in.  This is my third self built multi-rotor, and the second using a 3DRobotics FC.  I also have a self built deadcat quad with an APM 2.6.  Both copters are experiencing similar issues with the upgrade to ArduCopter V3.1.2.  The quad flew great prior to the upgrade.  After upgrading both to 3.1.2, I recalibrated everything. When I armed them and gave them throttle, the motors reached a constant speed near the bottom of the travel of the throttle stick and never increased in speed after that.  In Mission Planner under the Flight Data/Status Tab I see the following when I move my throttle stick up: * At about 1/4 throttle travel the output signal maxes out.  Any movement of the stick in the upper 3/4 range makes no change to the signal output to the ESCs.  The input signal (Ch3in) valuealways moves in proportion to the movement of the throttle stick travel.   It seems like there must be some settings within Arducopter that is limiting the max throttle output signal at around 1250.  The output signal value varies from channel to channel, usually ranging between around 1254 to 1334. Both multicopters are using different brand ESC’s and motors.  Any help would be appreciated.","Problem was solved by resetting the Pixhawk and reloading the firmware from a cleared Pixhawk. Resetting was done by doing a load of Ardupilot, then doing the Arducopter load."

The camera shutter pin is RC8 which is pin 8 on OUT of APM. assign RC8 in camera configuration for camera_shutter and connect the servo used for shutter to RC OUT 8 pin of APM (on the rear side). select camera_shutter to servo from Standard Parameter list. it then works fine. ofcourse you can chk the servo by assigning CH7 of Tx to camera trigger. now the shutter would work on using the command DO_DIGICAM_CONTROL in mission planner.

This video was recorded this evening, near Tromsø  with wind around 14m/s, strongest gusts at 21m/s.  - temperature was 3°C . It rained. (so I stand with my back to the wind, - no droplets on camera,  The house behind me provides great turbulence for the landing - as it’s hit by wind from seaside.) (best watched fullscreen, in HD, or else the display gets unreadable and the hexa small.) [youtube]* So developers: cheers !. Complainers: be a bit humble in help requests, and acknowledge the possibility that you may have created the problem.","Ok, I do not even disagree with you. If you follow this(and the old) forum for a while, you’ll see that I spend some time helping people out. So I do not aim at those decent, help seeking posts at all. - not even when when the cause is failure to RTFM. I do, however, have those in mind - that start out with claiming huge software bugs, call Ardu* a unreliable platform, “threaten” about switching to *** platform (as if we care) and generally just use big words and cocky attitude to tell us how “unsuitable” or dangerous Ardu* is."
450,Flight Modes,1,"Hi all, Firstly thanks to all the dev team and testers for this project… I actually have a working Quadcopter!  Following all the amazing guidance, I got it built from parts, and my Compassmot down from 320% to 3% - hopefully avoiding another crash… lol! Anyway, I have just installed Mission planner 1.2.97 and firmware V3.1.2, which I gather are the latest. The only oddity is that I now have ‘OF_loiter mode’ …I can see no mention of this anywhere… any ideas?? Thanks!","I believe that is loiter done with an optical flow sensor (camera-like motion sensing device) as opposed or in conjunction with a GPS. I’ve never bought the camera, but read somewhere that OF loiter doesn’t work well anyway."

451,Copterleds feature on Pixhawk?,1,I almost have my new frame ready to fly with the Pixhawk.   I’ve installed LED strings on my copter arms and wanted to run them with the Pixhawk just like APM with the CopterLeds feature.  Things like arm status and GPS lock are useful.  Much better than just the controller LEDS although the Pixhawk LEDs are much better than the APM. I think this feature at present is missing from Pixhawk.  I remember previous discussions on this subject.   The LEDs parameter is missing from Mission Planner for Pixhawk.  Are there any plans to move this feature or equivalent to Pixhawk? Thank you,"Agree, these AUX out pins are pretty useless at the moment. I also expected to be able to use them for LED control and/or RC channel passthru. LED out disappeared - I guess the idea was to use the “external LED” - which is unobtainium since we first heard of it … RC passthru is a weird mess - only thru crutches like CAM trigger / gimbal control. Maybe dump that gimbal code (servo controlled gimbals are pretty extinct anyway) and re-do the RC channel passthru in a simple, user-friendly way ? Very excited to see the dev efforts to get S-Bus channels 9-16 in - but what shall we do with these  "
452,Quadcopter Coupled Pitch and Roll,1,"I have been testing a new quad build for a couple weeks now and I can’t seem to get rid of this issue.  The problem is that when I make a pitch input, I get a pitch output coupled with a roll.   Making a roll input produces the same effect (roll output with coupled pitch), but it is not as drastic as on the pitch axis.  I have tried different props, swapping motors around, and checking that my center of gravity is coincident with my center of thrust. The quad is a custom built FPV frame similar to the QAV400, but slightly larger.  It is running a Pixhawk on 3.1.2 with 30A Afro ESCs, T-Motor MT-2216 900kV motors, and APC props. Can anyone provide some insight on what might be wrong? For a QAV style frame, should the frame type be set to X or H?  I am currently running X. Thanks, Kevin","Couple things off the top of my head: -Flight controller not square with the frame. -CG: how exactly are you adjusting it?  Does this frame have a trapezoid, square or rectangular motor layout?  There is a some erroneous information about CG location given by some of the multirotor manufacturers.  Particularly those with trapezoidal frames.  They say the CG should be on an intersection of the lines drawn cross-wise between the motors, but this is false. -Thruster imbalance:  Motors, props, esc’s, something wrong with one of them.  You said you’ve been looking for this already. -Thruster misalignment.  If for example, one of the motors is misaligned, when you pitch, it could create a yaw torque, which needs to be counteracted, and then results in a roll."

When doing the accelerometer calibration with a nonstandard AHRS orientation, should the quad be positioned on its front, left, right, etc. or should the Pixhawk be positioned on its front, left, right, etc. relative to its “forward” arrow?

I am setting the CG at the center of the motor layout, which is also where the Pixhawk is positioned.  Where should the CG be?"

Any dual rate? hook the APM up to your computer and see what it’s registering as far as signal goes from the receiver. Double check that you have indeed put the propellers on the correct way. Yes they are providing you all thrust. But they could be spinning the incorrect way and that would totally screw your Yaw. did you accidentally mix the arms up when you were putting the motors on? Yaw should be fairly fast. 1.5  sec~ ish on mine to do a 360.

456,Upgrading to Pixhawk Quad Crashes,1,"Hello, I originally switched my 3DR Hex (y6) from an APM to Pixhawk without issue - flies great. I decided to perform the same upgrade with my Quad.

Yes, I find the vibrations theory a bit sketchy too, because your X,Y vibrations are fine - but I don’t see any other reason to such behaviour. make sure you don’t have an solid part of the frame touching the top of pixhawk’s top/connectors. - a well mounted device, could sometimes get vibrations from above, if a solid plate is on top of it.  - I am guessing now - but you should take a look at the Z-vibrations just in case, I think it’s a probable cause."

Someone please analyse my logs and advice me on what could have happened. I checked the airframe for signs of any loose wires or connections but there was none. Seems like the copter somehow just disarmed while 130m AGL.",I have reposted this on a new post here:
459,Loiter rate... 0.2 too low?,1,"I loiter just great, but it’s sluggish in response to the controls. Jack the rate up?",I’ll answer part of this one too: I went from 0.2 to 0.4 loiter rate and it was downright unstable in loiter mode.  It almost did several flips of death and I finally got it back down on the ground.
460,Crash Analysis Help Please,1,"Pixhawk / APM 3.1.2 / Quad / Spectrum DX9 w/PPM Encoder Flew great all morning… Stabilize, Alt-Hold and Loiter. Then I go to recharge it and afterward it’s acting funny.  I have a mini-crash or two.  So I keep checking things and all the motors are spinning.  Nothing is getting hot either. I get it up in the air and it starts giving me trouble – almost impossible to control.  So I trigger a RTL mode with my switch and it lands me safely (even though that seemed a little “glitchy” (but it could have been a mild breeze too). Then I go up again – but slowly.  I enter loiter mode and it begins behaving just fine (like it did earlier).  Then a couple of minutes into the hover, I get a flip of death and it falls to the ground.  In my log, you can clearly see me enter loiter mode Right around the time of the crash, you can see an “RTL” tag – and I’m 100% sure I didn’t trigger an RTL Then right after the RTL tag, I see a “Stabilize” tag – and I’m 100% sure I didn’t change to stabilize either  Would someone mind looking at my log and seeing if they recognize the problem?  I swear I wonder if the transmitter, receiver or PPM encoder was sending nonsense to the Pixhawk RC inputs.  That would be the only explanation, because everything else appears to be mechanically sound.","So I answered my own question. The connector pins on the RC input to the Pixhawk were loose for some reason.  The connector was in the correct position, but the pins didn’t tightly engage the FCS’s pins. So when I wiggled the connector, the switches were going crazy mid-flight.  It looked like the craft was being bounced from Stabilize to Alt-Hold to Loiter and from RTL and Save Trim. Now I need to go back and figure-out how to undo all those bad save trim values I was capturing.  I’ll probably just revert back to an old parameter set and see if that works.  That would also explain why it drifted so badly in Stabilize and Alt-Hold mode (it probably had bad save trim values)."
461,Does Stabilize mode utilize the compass and barometer?,1,"As the title says, are the compass and/or barometer utilized when in Stabilzed mode? If so is it possible for them to affect copter performance or even cause a crash? Thanks, Steve","The “simple” mode modifier (a checkbox in Mission Planner) determines whether the compass is used for heading. In Stabilize non-Simple mode, the compass is not used. The barometer is not used in stabilize, only in Alt Hold, Loiter, Auto et al."

461,Does Stabilize mode utilize the compass and barometer?,3,"As the title says, are the compass and/or barometer utilized when in Stabilzed mode? If so is it possible for them to affect copter performance or even cause a crash? Thanks, Steve","That’s not correct. The compass is always used in all modes.  It plays a simple role to eliminate gyro drift on the Z axis.  That’s really all that it does.  Simple mode or not.  Simple mode does not really look at the compass directly for any sort of control either.  It’s the same thing, the compass just eliminates yaw gyro drift.  The yaw control is still done primarily by the gyros. It’s pretty hard to figure how the compass could cause a crash.  The only way I could see, is a complicated mechanism whereby, say the compass was completely backwards.  And you were flying highly dynamically.  The AHRS uses GPS data to determine accelerations.  If the compass was backwards, these accelerations would be backwards, and it would cause an AHRS error.  But even that would likely be a fairly small effect, and it’s hard to see how it would cause a crash.  It would have to be extreme circumstances. The baro has even less effect.  It’s really only used to stabilize the inertial altitude reference in Alt Hold and Loiter mode."
461,Does Stabilize mode utilize the compass and barometer?,4,"As the title says, are the compass and/or barometer utilized when in Stabilzed mode? If so is it possible for them to affect copter performance or even cause a crash? Thanks, Steve","The one scenario where the compass can screw you up, is if it’s mounted wrong, or you’ve chosen the wrong orientation in the configuration.   Roll-180, Yaw-90, something other than it really is.   While this doesn’t hurt you in stabilized mode, as soon as you switch to something else Loiter or Auto, or invoke RTL and your copter takes off in an unexpected direction, over your head head and you lose orientation. Yeah, that can crash you.   BTDT. While it’s not a direct cause, the miss-configuration is, and one can argue that “You shouldn’t have done that”, and “If you didn’t suck as a pilot you’d a saved that”. It can all come down pretty quickly.    "
462,LED Mode Clarification,1,"Hi All, Having searched through this and other forums, I’m still unclear on the functions of A4-A11.  So here goes my first post… Could someone clarify the function of the external LED/outputs A4-A11? I think I understand some of these.  By using the correct mask in LED_MODE A5 can be used to indicate a low battery condition and A6 will indicate the GPS lock.  Also we can use the LED_MODE mask to blink either or both the GPS and Motor LEDs when a way point is reached in Auto mode.  However, I’m not clear on the function of A4 Aux and A7-A11 Motor LEDs. Further I see we can change the Low Battery Flash to slow/fast (or oscillate), but not disable it.  Which output would this setting affect?  My assumption would be just the Motor LEDs, but it could be all of them. Thanks Chris","*, This link might help you: * Regards, TCIII GM"

There are additional modes you can arm in once you’re more experienced with the flight characteristics (Loiter, Guided, etc.)  Depending on what you’re trying to accomplish, Stabilized is likely the most common flight mode to arm and take off.

467,Can I fly my quadcopter using my radio's expo/dual rate?,1,"Hi I was curious if I can use my radio’s expo and/or dual rate to fly my quadcopter. I want it to fly a bit more smoothly on the sticks e.g. indoor flight or for video recording. In other words less sensitive on the sticks.

I’m not sure if expo and dual rate would conflict in any way with the flight modes like Loiter, Althold, Stabilise, …and especially with Drift mode. I’m using APM 2.6 V3.1 with GPS and a DX9 radio.","It works fine and I often use it for pitch, roll or yaw. It’s especially useful in yaw if you want to do a very slow pan when taking video. There are arguments both ways whether it’s “best” to use either expo or dual rates. I tend to prefer using expo as I know that in an emergency I have full control by simply moving the sticks to their limits. I’f I’m using dual rate I’d have to switch out of it first.  Using it on throttle would probably be bad news, but the other controls are fine. As far as I know there’s no conflict with any of the APM modes. I usually use expo in either Loiter or Alt Hold if I’m trying to get decent video. Works great."

480,Drift mode lost orientation,1,"Yesterday I was flying in drift mode for a few minutes at high speeds up to 25-30 knots and doing very hard turns.  5 or 6 passes into doing this the APM seemed to have lost orientation.  I was up at the top of a semi stall turn (at least what the quad will do) and when I leveled out at the bottom the quad would not respond as normal.  I let it slow down and stop, and when stopped the yaw control (normal aileron but I was in drift mode) was banking the quad while I was not moving.  In drift mode this should have only been a yaw input and if it was moving, it was way too slow for the bank angles the quad was using.  I also noticed it was having issues keeping itself level.  I gained some altitude and switched to stabilize and it flew fine.  Is this something unique to my quad?  Or is this something that happens in drift mode when doing sustained high speed flight?","Hmmm… this is interesting… There can be a problem in drift mode if you are banking and yanking at high speeds (>15 m/s) but the problem is really only to do with the copter trying to turn to hard, and can start wobbling around, it goes away if you simply release the roll stick. I can’t figure any reason why you would have had the problem you’re describing.  Logs would help. What you are describing sounds more like a general loss of orientation that is not restricted to Drift mode.  I’ve done quite a bit of very high speed bank and yank type flying stabilize mode, and have never had a problem, though in Stabilize I guess it would be less obvious if the compass heading was off.

What you described is probably what happened.  I was moving pretty quick (25-30kts on telemetry) when it happened for a sustained amount of time.  About halfway through the turn I noticed it wasnt behaving correctly and let it stop itself using the auto brake.  Once stopped I tried turning it back towards home but what should have been only a yaw input because I had zero speed was putting a large bank into the quad.  Along with the yaw and incorrect bank it was too much for me to figure out so i gained altitude and switched to stab and it was all ok.  Is this just the sensors getting confused occasionally?  I have flown in drift before for very extended lengths of time slowly, but never at sustained high speed for that long."

But in neither case is it the “sensors getting confused”.  If that were the case, it would happen in all modes, not just Drift. I wonder if it’s possible that your problem was more related to a GPS glitch?  That would affect Drift mode since it’s using the GPS for part of it’s control strategy.  Without logs, impossible to say."

What do you think ? Tristan","Odd, I thought I posted a reply to this thread but it vanished.  So I’ll try again… I agree this would be an excellent idea. I think the way Circle mode currently operates is a little clunky.  If an operator is interested in videoing a particular location they must start Circle mode while the craft is pointed at the location, but offset a distance equal to the preprogrammed radius. Personally, I find it hard to accurately estimate the radial distance if the quad is hundreds (or even thousands) of feet away. As a result I usually end up getting images of the slightly wrong area. I think this idea can even be further improved by making the radius a tunable value, adjustable on the RC transmitter by switch or knob (Channel 6 tuning) on the fly. That could allow for imaging an area fully around from multiple distances during the same flight. Finally, if the present Circle mode operation is of value to people, perhaps the specific type of Circle mode operation could be user-selectable in Mission Planner?"

484,Testing Arducopter documentation for PX4,1,"Hi there, posting to this forum because my focus is on arducopter documentation as it pertains to the PX4 rather than PX4 hardware itself. It seems that the Arducopter documentation is quite often incorrect for the PX4 platform. I suspect that the authors are APM users and are unable to test the documentation for a PX4, and there are slight differences in operation between the two platforms. As a PX4 user, is it possible to lend a hand and test the documentation for the PX4 platform? If so, can someone can point me in the right direction to get involved (rather than posting errata here on the forum)? As an example, consider the compassmot tuning guide:(*). Neither of my 2 PX4’s will allow access to the console if the instructions are followed. Instead the LiPo connection needs to be the last step after the console is activated. There is also a long-standing bug (perhaps always) in the PX4IO codebase (issue #653) that means the battery sensor does not detect current. Therefore on a PX4 platform you need to switch battery monitoring off to run compassmot or you get an error and compensation is disabled. cheers, rhys","Hi Rhys It would be great to have you involved in the documentation. I’ll  send you a PM and get you set up with our wiki editors group Thanks, Craig"

487,Bug with auto landing in RTL?,1,"So. All calibrated and configured according to the manual. Althold works perfectly. Loiter - perfect. Flight by waypoints - perfect.

Here’s an example graph reduction and climb, guided: Red line - baro Green - ThrOut This chart everything is fine, when we collect height - just added Thr when reduce height - slightly reduced Thr.  * Now the problem: When I turn on RTL mode home copter arrives at the point perfectly, but with a progressive decline is fast and he hit the ground at high speed. Parameter Land speed and Speed Dn has no effect on the rate of descent. But the strangest thing we see when we open graphics:  At the beginning of the decline, on the graph shows that the percentage of gas becomes 100%, then starts falling copter on the ground. But in the real gas is not 100%. And it is not connected to the battery, or with something else! This can be seen in the attached log file.

","Hello, welcome and nice sharp looking quad! I can’t diagnose this properly without motor logging (MOT message) turned on. I suspect you are simply underpowered - you hover at around 72% throttle. Have you calibrated your ESCs? That 72% might actually be 80-90%. Can you fly around in stabilize without a descent? Edit: I sort of suspect that it couldn’t handle a descent into its own prop wash because it is so underpowered. So it probably got into a vortex ring state and couldn’t get out. Calm day or was there wind? Ultimately I think you need more power."

The compass is aligned correctly   When doing a ground test, mission planner shows correct heading.

I think the last version it flew correctly with was 2.8.1. After 2.9 and beyond, my APM 2.0 never flew right until the day it buried itself in the dirt. Now, (rebuild mode) I’ve compiled 2.8.1 on my own because you can’t download it any more. And the compile instructions don’t work, so you have to figure that out. You’ll have to use an earlier version of Mission Planner too. I don’t mind so much that the project has marched on into the future, but I wish it had left behind better support for earlier adopters. Just somewhere to go for APM 2.0 users that says “You need to load this this and this”, and it’s all ready to install. TECHNICALLY… You can run the latest version. But unless you are into cutting runs and soldering (and trusting your work) it’ll fly like crap. Reason being the new code is written to perform well on the Ublox gps and we have Mediatek. So the quad hops around like a jumping bean on a hot griddle in any “position hold” mode. My APM 2.0 will probably end up in a plane where it should work better. For now it’s just another spare, used part laying around. Not sure if I’ll finish rebuilding or not.  "

My guess is that it’s the GPS that is the problem or our inertial nav is not well tuned to work with the Mediatek.  Although we did test somewhat with the Mediatek a long time ago,  we’ve tuned the inertial nav to work best with the Ublox which is a 5hz update rate (vs 10hz for the Mediatek) but also the lag on the Ublox is much less (about 0.3sec vs 1.0 second for the Mediatek). Personally I just don’t think it’s worth trying to get a decent loiter with a Mediatek.  Before inertial nav we spent literally months of developer time trying to get a good solid loiter with the Mediatek.  At one point we had 3 developers all working on different methods to try and improve the loiter.  They all failed and then the Ublox showed up and Loiter instantly got a lot better."

If the issue is that the inertial nav is not well tuned to the Mediatek GPS it might help to reduce the INAV_TC_XY parameter.  This controls how much influence the GPS position has on the accel+GPS position estimate.  A lower number means “trust the accels more, the GPS less”.  During testing with the UBLOX I tested values from 1.0 up to 2.5 and found very little difference but with the Mediatek it might help.  If the number is made too low then the position estimate will just drift off.  If it’s too high then the position estimate will be just like the GPS value and will jump around a lot."

So, going on the assumption that the problem is the GPS, you might be able to tune the INAV to use the mediatek by increasing INAV_TC_XY and also by changing the code to delay buffer more accelerometer samples (currently it buffers 15, if I recall). Keep in mind that ublox is 100x better than MTK and you will never loiter nearly as well with an MTK."

Connect the APM to MP and verify COM port and baud rates, then disconnect APM from computer USB Set putty to log all screen data. Set putty for a serial interface using the above com and baud rates Connect the APM to the computer USB Open the putty session When you start to text on the terminal screen hit [enter] 3 times You should now be connected to the APM interface. Go to your logs and attempt to ‘dump’. When you find a corrupt value that ‘locks’ the interface, no worries, putty has captured all the data in its screen logging file. Repeat process as many times as you need to get all your log files. Review a ‘normal’ MP log file output to reformat (delete) unnecessary lines from the PuTTY capture.

495,Failed to Land Batt FS,1,"I have a Pixhawk installed in my 3DR X8 running 3.1. Was testing my FPV setup, so perhaps not as aware as I should be of the time, and battery level.

I think it’s just that the battery was on it’s last legs and these Lipos lose their voltage very rapidly right at the end.  I don’t think it’s a firmware issue. The copter was actually in AltHold in the final stages although as you say it did switch to LAND before that, as part of the battery failsafe."

I can see that if it is landing on people or in a lake, the pilot should be able to try to rescue it. Therefore, in this case, it let me do the RTL. But:  if I have land instead of RTL set as an option, perhaps it should reconsider letting me do RTL. If I were to elect RTL as an option, I would probably trigger it to FS at a slight higher voltage. there’s always the option of right stick during a land command, as a means of avoiding trouble. the LAND action was not noticeable. As you see, the altitude was flat the whole time and no adjustment of throttle on my part. Is there an adjustment to make the “Land” a little more obvious? A higher descent rate… (SOME descent rate)?  My batteries seemed to charge fine, they’re new… we’ll have to see how they last during following flights."

496,Strange problem with veering,1,"Ok, so this is a strange problem I’m having with my quad.  I take off as normal in stabilise. It flies fine. I “squirt” it to 60% throttle - it veers massively towards motor 2 I regain control, BUT… I have to maintain the corrective stick! ie if it took 40% roll and 40% pitch to correct the veer, I have to hold 40% roll and 40% pitch to keep it straight. I land, and check it over - everything is fine - motors and props are all tight I unpower the quad, and repower it… AND IT FLIES FINE AGAIN.  This process is repeatable; cause the veer…correct it…hold the correction…land…reboot APM…everything is fine. Ideas??? What can anyone see in the log?","You might want to consider turning on your motor logging and do another flight. That will let you see what commands the APM is sending to each motor. In looking at your log, your roll tracks fairly well with your RollIn, but your pitch is quite off from your PitchIn. At this point I’d suspect one or more of your ESCs aren’t calibrated properly or perhaps a mechanical problem."
497,Best Failsafe Practice?,1,"A general question, since I fly both ArduCopter and ArduPlane I noticed a slight difference in actions to failsafe and recovering out of failsafe. Arducopter activates RTL when it sees the low throttle failsafe value and jumps back to whatever flightmode was active before when recovering from failsafe - since the flight mode channel also changes values based on RX failsafe. ArduPlane activates CIRCLE/RTL when it sees the low throttle failsafe value but unlike Arducopter it stays in RTL untill you purposely toggle the flightmode switch. Even it sees at the time of recovery the same flightmode channel value change as the ArduCopter it ignores at that time the flightmode change. With my latest TX/RX systems all channels would teach a failsafe value. So I always setup flight mode RTL at 1500uS and also teach the flightmode channel the 1500uS failsafe value together with the throttle channel to the lowest value to activate throttle failsafe. I am wondering if with ArduCopter it is wanted to go back immediately to any previous flightmode? Or wouldn’t it be better to stay in RTL and have the pilot control the recovery by toggling the flightmode channel? Or am I doing something wrong with my setup? take care, Det","Arducopter does not change from failsafe mode, unless you change the flight mode. You must have failsafe set in rx that changes the mode.

Before I had a FrSky RX and now I am using a ezUHF - both RX teach all channels a failsafe value. So I can not prevent the flight mode channel to change its value to the taught failsafe value. FrSky was even worse as they output a 1500uS value for 3-4sec during startup independent of what failsafe value you had taught in the RX. But Tridge did it somehow different with the Arduplane. There it ignores any flightmode change when going to failsafe and coming out of it. The Arducopter does that not - it switches right back to whatever mode the flightmode channel jumps to when it recovers it signal. Can you imagine an intermittent signal loss? Or lets say I fly in a non stabilized mode and it goes to failsafe. While I am checking my gear it gets back into signal range and switches back for example to ACRO because that was the mode I was flying in before? I think it would be beneficial to ignore mode changes for a second when the copter sees that throttle failsafe recovers. So the copter stays in RTL till I toggle the switch and not my RX by changing mode value because it comes out of RX failsafe. UPDATE: I have to revise my statement that ArduPlane does it different. For some reason on the bench test it stayed in RTL turning the TX off and on but on the field flying really out of range it also jumped back to the previous flight mode."

501,GPS position glitches causes fly aways,1,"Hi, * During telemetry analysis I noticed that fused position reported by copter (GLOBAL_POSITION_INT) was exactly the opposite to the direction of the actual movement. I.e. reported position moved 10 meters to the South, but copter physically moved 10 meters to the North, i.e. trying to compensate the difference to stay in the same position as before. Also I noticed, that GPS satellite count dropped from 8-9 to 6-7 during this time. So the position glitch was likely caused by GPS, which is OK as such (GPS is unreliable or maybe my copter is vibrating too much, or interference, whatever) and could happen sometimes. But questions are the following:   Copter tried to compensate the position difference using full throttle! It pitched almost to 45 degrees and pushed some real power to the props accelerating my quad like a rocket, while my maximum Loiter and Auto navigation speeds are very moderate. So question is - why copter is doing full-throttle to compensate GPS position glitches? This is so dangerous, because user does not expect the copter to fly so fast. Why not just compensate the position using usual navigation speed?   I understand, that final copter position is filtered (fused) from GPS and IMU data (Kallman filters and so on). Assuming that IMU based position wasn’t changed, why sudden GPS position glitches (20-30 meters as I said) affect the fused position so much? As I said, copter literally jumped some 20 meters away in 1-2 seconds using full throttle.

Andrey.","Nice graphs you’ve produced there. So the reason that the copter takes off when it hits a glitch is because the large position jump also affects the estimated velocity and acceleration.  So the filter is trying to keep an estimate of it’s velocity and acceleration that all “makes sense” based on the acceleration and positions it’s seeing.  So if it sees a sudden position drop it say, “oh shoot, if I moved that far then my velocity estimate must be wrong”.  Then it says, “oh shoot, my velocity is much higher than I want so I’d better slow down” so it leans back against the glitch.  From an objective point of view the pilot says it’s acting crazy but from the “blind” copter it thinks it must have been pushed by a heck of a gust of wind and so it compensates aggressively. AC3.1 include GPS Glitch detection.  * So you’ll see on that page that there are some parameters that can be adjusted to tighten up on the detection.  GPSGLITCH_ACCEL is set to 10m/s/s maximum (i.e. 1000), the GPSGLITCH_RADIUS is set to 2m (i.e. 200).  The GPSGLITCH_RADIUS is probably the most important, you could try reducing it to 100 or 150.   If it’s set too low though it will cause false positives which will trigger lands. BTW there are no changes in the inertial nav, loiter or waypoint navigation between AC3.0.1 and AC3.1 (with the exception of the glitch detection) so if it wasn’t happening before it’s more likely that it’s some environment or copter set-up change that is making it more common.  FPV equipment too close to the GPS is one common cause."

Andrey.","Hi, sorry for late reply, there were no notification to email… Thank you, I understand your explanations in general and agree with this: But what is still suspicious is why this “leaning” happens so fast, i.e. almost on a full throttle? I’m again risking to be punished for “theoretical discussion” on this forum (sorry), but still want to share my thoughts about what I personally consider a bug or a space for improvement, namely the inadequate reactions to big GPS positions jumps. The main source of position and velocity estimation should be inertial and mag units, only they affect the real-time stabilization of the copter, right? GPS position in turn, is more like a background-lazy source which is much less reliable compared to inertial/mag units and definitely should not affect any real-time stabilization/behavior. So, I think, when copter sees big GPS position jumps, it should behave like “Oh gosh, GPS position jumped too far, but according to my inertial unit I’m standing still, let’s lean slowly to the new GPS position”. So the GPS position effect should be gentle. But I faced more specific problem. I have disabled GPS glitch protection and flyway happened again during the first minute after the takeoff (I managed to recover in stabilize mode). I noticed that right before the flyway the number of satellites dropped from 6 to 5 and even 4, this nicely explains GPS glitches. But what worries me is HDOP value which was almost 2.9 during first few minutes of the flight, despite the fact that GPS_HDOP_GOOD param on my copter is 200 (HDOP=2). So why I was able to arm my copter having HDOP of 2.9 while maximum allowed is 2? I have a feeling, that GPS glitch probability could be significantly reduced by allowing GPS unit to grab a better HDOP before taking of. Notice, that during the flight the number of satellites jumped to 9 and even 10 which reduced HDOP below 2, which is very good value. As I see from parameters, there is no such which controls the minimum number of acquired satellites for arm check, right? Only GPS_HDOP_GOOD which is my case didn’t work as I expected."

503,Throttle and pitch sticks swapped in RC calibration,1,I recently received the pixhawk flight board and I’ve been trying to set it up with my x shaped quad. I’ve calibrated everything but I’ve noticed that the throttle stick (left non springy stick) controls the pitch levels from 1083 to 1748 and the right stick controls the throttle from 998 to 1850. I’m using a Spektrum DX5e controller with a spektrum receiver. How do I switch this so that the throttle is controlled with the correct stick?? I have not been able to get the quad to arm and the motors to throttle up. I assume this is because my controllers sticks are swapped and I can’t get into auto ESC calibration mode.

503,Throttle and pitch sticks swapped in RC calibration,2,I recently received the pixhawk flight board and I’ve been trying to set it up with my x shaped quad. I’ve calibrated everything but I’ve noticed that the throttle stick (left non springy stick) controls the pitch levels from 1083 to 1748 and the right stick controls the throttle from 998 to 1850. I’m using a Spektrum DX5e controller with a spektrum receiver. How do I switch this so that the throttle is controlled with the correct stick?? I have not been able to get the quad to arm and the motors to throttle up. I assume this is because my controllers sticks are swapped and I can’t get into auto ESC calibration mode. I also can’t manually calibrate them because my receiver has no throttle output. I hope some kind soul out there can help me resolve this problem! Thanks in advance.,Did you try switching the pitch and throttle leads on the receiver?

However I found the real issue was that I had to switch my DX5e from mode 1 to mode 2. Apparently this switch is hidden under the front cover next to the other 5 servo switches, so I had to unscrew the back and then unscrew the motherboard to get to the front and flip the switch. After all that and some more trouble shooting I was able to get my system to arm! However there are two new problems… I was only able to arm it when holding the throttle stick down and to the LEFT… I tried to reverse the rudder servo but then it wouldn’t arm at all. The other issue is that when it arms the motors start spinning pretty fast with the throttle all the way down. Although this might just be a parameter issue that I haven’t looked at yet. I hope someone can help me resolve these issues! Thanks again "

509,Controls reverse before crash,1,"Over the past six months or so I’ve noticed something that I simply couldn’t believe and therefore put off to bad flying skills, interference or anything but a problem with the APM/Arducopter. What happens is that while flying the copter becomes a bit unstable which increases but then I notice the reason it’s so difficult to correct is that the controls are reversed. So copter is diving left, I apply right stick and copter goes left more. As I said, it just seems so odd and it’s been very rare so I really didn’t think too much about it. But after a crash tonight I kept my calm a bit more during the event and realised early on that the controls were indeed reversed so I managed to do a fairly soft ditch of the copter and avoid too much damage. I had a look at the attached log and it sure looks to me that even though there is no pitch/roll in, that there is a lot of pitch/roll happening. I’m beginning to wonder if the issue isn’t that the controls are reversing but rather perhaps what is happening is that I’m no longer flying in simple mode and therefore the control is based on which way the copter is facing. I doubt the logs show this but I know what I experienced and this time I paid very close attention. This is about the fourth time I’ve seen this on different copters and I’m wondering if anyone else has had such an experience. I know that everyone wants their logs analysed but I honestly think that there may be an  unidentified issue here that’s been hidden for a while.","Are you saying that when the aircraft is flying towards you it lowers the left side as you look at it which is its right side in flight. Then you add more right and of course it goes right harder! If this is what is happening remember this little maxim With the aircraft pointing towards you the joystick is pointed at the lower wing to lift it. Try flying figure 8’s at slow speed from left to to right in front of yourself, this is a very handy exercise. If that’s not what you are saying ask again!"

Push the stick left, copter goes left. But for some reason, and I’m not sure if it’s related to simple mode not working or not, when the copter becomes unstable when I push the stick left the copter goes right. The copter was too far away to tell what the orientation was at the time so I’m not sure if it’s a case of it dropping out of simple mode or some other issue. But now that it’s happened a few times I’ve become concerned about it. I looked at the logs but my log analysis skills are still fairly basic. If I’m interpreting them correctly, at the end of the flight it shows no input to the sticks (even though there was) and the pitch/roll going up and down. Sure looks odd to me. But it would be helpful to have a better analysis of the log. I’m wondering if this is a case of cpu or memory exhaustion in which case there wouldn’t be any evidence in the log. Or would there? Also, two of the instances (but they are about four months apart) where in the same exact flying location. Just recently someone told me that others have had odd things happen in that location so there could be some sort of interference there."

It might be good to remove the Pixhawk from the frame (or at least detach the lines to the ESC) and connect a separate servo or ESC+motor to one of the pixhawk’s outputs and see if it’s works.  Basically I’m just trying to think of ways that we could test if the Pixhawk is outputting a pwm value on the output pins.  Another way to test would be to use a servo tester.

It is not so fine that the original 3DR ESCs have this issue. Is there a more elegant way to flash them with another firmware? I am not so experienced in soldering very small parts.

It worked well at the beginning of my flights with 3.1.1 RC 2. The problem starts with 3.1.1. and going back to 3.1.1 RC2 didn´t solve it. I played a litle bit with qgroundcontrol in between. Maybe the problem is located on the IO board, but for me it is not clear how this is updated. Or maybe I updated it with qgroundcontrol and can´t be downgraded to the 3DR version? Or are they the same? I did not found much documents regarding to this. And btw. I am using the old 3DR ESC´s which I bought around two years ago from 3DR. Not the simonk version.

Land ? Get it home or safe manually ? (If in clear sight) Please let me know what experience advises… Greetings, Ender","Enderffx, That’s right.  There’s no detection of a motor failure.  Maybe some day when we have “smart ESCs”. Landing ASAP is the only thing you can try.  I’m not actually sure though that the hexacopter will stay upright.  A Y6 will but perhaps not a hexacopter.  It will at least lose yaw control so RTL will be completely impossible."

522,ArduCopter 3.1- Pixhawk- DJI F450 Kit issues,3,"This may or may not be the right place to post this but I figured I would. ok, so I currently have setup The Pixhawk FC running Ardu copter 3.1 A 5V BEC 4 DJI 30 AMP ESC OPTO 4 DJI 920 Motors TBS Discovery Plates Spektrum DX7 for remote Spectrum Satellite receiver plugged directly into the FC Everything was going fine until I tried to hook the ESCs and Motors to the FC. Now when I connect the batter to the Power Module that came with the FC the FC comes up fine but the Motors start making a beeping sound and vibrate a little, like they are trying to spin.  If I unplug all the motors then no sound is present.  But when I plug them back in it starts up again. I have read things about the low throttle but I got that set below 1000 and still not working, any other suggestions? Also with this setup do I need the BEC or can i lose it? Things I have tried NOTE:  When I say ESC is beeping, When I unplug the motors from the ESCs and plug everything in nothing beeps, but when I plug the motors back in, even just one, they beep.  Not sure if this is normal.   Remove the Power Module that came with the FC and just supply straight power to the Frame (PDB build it) which powers the ESC to Motor Directly.  Motors beep about every second and vibrate a little.   Plug Power Module in without FC behing plugged in then plug in battery.  Motors still beep every second and vibrate a little.   Plug in battery to Power Module but not to frame let FC power up then plug in frame.  Motors still beep every second and vibrate a little.   Plug Power Module in to battery while connected to frame.  let flight controller boot up, motors still beeping and vibrating a little.  Then I press and hold the saftly switch to solid red.  Motors start beeping very fast.   I have read from here that the beep every second could mean Input signal abnormal and the steady beep could mean Throttle Stick is not at bottom. I am at a lose I have been on the internet all night and found things and tried them but no luck…and now on top of that when I go to callibrate my remote the Throttle stick isnt picking up it is putting the pitch switch for both pitch and throttle and I change the channel in the settings but it just changes back.

When I tried this the first time the radio wasnt bound correctly so the throttle wasnt all the way down, hints why the beeped really fast.  I have gotten the quad hovering and even flew it outside for a bit today, the Weight is a little off but I will fix that. Thanks for the reply."

It’s my first time building my own quad.","Hi Dave, A couple of things pop out.   It sounds like you might have some kind of programmed mixing taking place in your transmitter. I am pretty sure you don’t want that. You should program your transmitter for straight normal airplane acro mode. Even for a copter: throttle - rudder - aileron - elevator operation, no elevons, flaperons or mix or any of that stuff.   You need to have 4 servo signal cables for channels 1 through 4 for Throttle, aileron, rudder and elevator. Plus one more (Channel 5) for mode select hooked to a 3 position switch if possible.   On the APM you are not set up to run PPM without specially binding your transmitter for it so the 5 cable setup will work just fine. On the receiver side it is perfectly fine to run all the 3 wire cables with signal, power and ground. But you can also run signals only for four of the channels and power and ground on the fifth one (it normally doesn’t matter which one).   Alternatively you can on some FRSky receivers use PPM-Sum if you want but you have to bind the receiver as specified in the FRSky manual especially for it with the correct jumper in the receiver. Then you run a single 3 wire (power signal ground) cable from the channel specified for PPM-Sum in the FRSky receiver to the PPM-Sum input on the APM.   From a practical standpoint, for the time being it is probably easier to run all 5 signals in normal PWM mode. Best Regards,   Gary"

Thanks, Fred",I stand suitably chastised - humble apologies etc. I have stock 3DR quad with APM 2.6 and the 880KV motors.  Acquired new as RTF.  I was running 3.01 and upgraded today to 3.1.  This was after replacing arm/motor from crash caused by prop breaking early in last flight.  Currently using Spektrum DX7 with AR7000.  I had a few connectivity issues during firmware upgrade and had to start it 3 times.  It also took me back through initial setup which I wasn’t aware it would do but that went fine. My first thought when the motors did not spin when armed was that the firmware upgrade failed but when connecting to Terminal in Mission Planner it reports version 3.1.  Arming is successful and test flight was as expected.  I made a few other innocuous changes in parameters just to make sure they were taking properly.  Not sure why the MOT_SPIN_ARMED isn’t working as expected. I suspect the flux capacitor.
531,MOT_SPIN_ARMED not spinning,3,"Hi - just upgraded to 3.1.  MOT_SPIN_ARMED is set to 70 but no spin when armed.  Any idea why? Thanks, Fred",It’s more likely that it’s the ESCs deadzone at the bottom of their range or that the ESCs haven’t been calibrated so the bottom of the range doesn’t line up with the lowest value being output by the AC firmware. So a few solutions:  try recalibrating the ESCs.   copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/initia … esc-motor/  try increasing the MOT_SPIN_ARMED to something higher like 100.  It needs to be lower than the THR_MIN parameter which defaults to 130 so if it’s still not spinning when you set MOT_SPIN_ARMED to 130 then you may need to increase the THR_MIN as well…this is pretty unlikely to be necessary though.

Pitch Min was 1112, while usually being around at least 1120. Since I’ve corrected these parameters manually, MOT_SPIN_ARMED now works again! These low values appear - reproducibly with my RC - to be some glitches that are recorded for a very short period when moving these controls.

What I did was set the failsafe of the 9x while pushing the throttle down pretty hard, so it would go to a value which would not be achieved in normal operations. I set this value then as throttle failsafe value as explained in the *. YOu can get a similar effect by “miscalibrating” your 9x sticks before setting failsafe and recalibrating them properly afterwards. But you can even much easier create a pseudo-failsafe by setting your flight mode selection switches to the position for RTL and then save this as failsafe value in the 9x."

For a cheap system like the Turnigy, the PWM is practically always fluttering a bit, so if it’s steadily the same value, that could be an indication of a problem. The APM’s PPM-decoder AFAIK does not check this hence can’t recognize this as a failsafe condition. But for anyone to be able to answer the question in the topic title, you would have to provide technical details, such as a signal recording from your RX out and a detailed description of the technical function of your failsafe device.

If i am doing something dumb here please let me know, want to protect my investment !!!","Hello Stefan, the $3 Failsafe immediatly recognizes when i turn off the Tx. The APM acts as if the last signal is repeated forever. So i (and many other guys in the world) were indeed under the impression that this is a hopeless case apart from such heuristics you propose. And i would not deem that way of detection really failsafe btw. But one cool guy just tried it out with a cheap failsafe and the failsafe WAS able to detect the signal loss instantly (for the human eye, so at least within 1/5th of a second). For one i do not think that this device has heuristics (and someone dares to use it) and on the other hand that detection time is too short to work even if such risky assumptions would have been applied. I bought the same Failsafe and it works BUT i also dug in my RC stuff and found a 25 year old “HiTec” Failsafe from one of my gas driven boats. Guess what: it also works. So there must be a twitch in the signal when Tx is lost that is detectable by very easy means. That sound pretty much like the PPM decoder is the “bad guy” repeating values if the signal is not allright. I learned on the arducopter site that somewhere there is an archive of different PPM decoder firmwares but the link is dead. As for the technical details (And people who might be ABLE to help) Others tried the same setup too and i have not read of ONE case where the simple failsafe (of whatever brand or make) did NOT work and the only needed Hardware is a 9x (or 9XR) and the v2 8 channel receiver. Its a widespread problem as the 9x is so dirt cheap and the subject says enough for people in the know and more is lost for people who don’t. MAYBE the PPM decoder has no error handling except repeating the last signal which would be close to criminal. I do not know a wide range of Rx’es, but the ones that i do know hande the Failsafe by themselves outputting a preset value. THIS is how throttle failsafe works in its core, no PPM decoder magic involved. But maybe there are other Rx strategies (or lack of them) that ARE handled by the PPM decoder, i cannot know this. I do not have the tools at home to deliver signal logs but i hoped that someone reads here who has a KNOWLEDGE of the PPM decoder and where to find variations or how to modify and rebuild it. That is obviously not the case so i am out of luck. Have a nice day."

If i am doing something dumb here please let me know, want to protect my investment !!!","I think, you are missing the point here. The PPM encoder’s task is to encode a PPM signal. It’s failsafe function is to drop the throttle channel to 900 when the PWM signals stop, i.e. are not present any more. THAT is the failsafe function of the PPM encoder. If you have an RX which just continues outputting the last PWM from before the signal loss, that’s not the task of the PPM encoder to detect. If an operator uses such an RX, the operator did not read the hardware and accessory recommendations for building UAS based on the APM. Normally, with those cheap RXs you don’t need heuristics to detect a radio failure. On failsafe, the last PWM value is usually repeated exactly and identical which usually never happens in normal operation. The normal pulse width in PWM is between 1 and 2 ms so if I take your estimated 200ms reaction time, your failsafe would have time to check like 50 or so pulses and if they are all identical, decide that it’s a failsafe condition."

You normally should not have to have the battery connected when you are testing this with power being provided by USB except as noted below.   Possibly your receiver is hooked up wrong to the APM by the servo cables (You definitely need to have at least one of the servo leads with a power and ground so the servo connector can power the receiver.)   Possibly the receiver isn’t getting power from the APM via the same servo cables. (should be obvious generally by led on receiver indicating it is up and running or not.) (Also, although rare, some receivers may draw too much power from the APM for the USB to provide adequate power to the receiver). At least some of the receivers you have mentioned should not draw too much power.   Assuming your radio is working correctly (as you have stated) then all that is left is the APM not working properly). But if you are able to do the other interactions with the APM in Mission planner via the USB connection it is pretty unlikely that the APM is broken.

Thanks for any help.","@ Arteman, Although generally you do not need to do so and for safety reasons (props on motors) should not. Having the main battery and USB hooked up simultaneously is acceptable and should not damage APM or USB. Some receivers and particularly with 3DR PPM encoder draw too much power for the normal USB port to provide. For those instances at least it is necessary to hook up battery and USB simultaneously if only for calibrating radio (remove props). This is true for APM and PX4/Pixhawk controllers."

You could try a new gps from ebay.  I got a ublox gps with compass on it for 30 dollars and a case with a stand for 10. I get 12 satellites on it outside.
536,Compassmot and compass offsets troubles,9,"Hi, Currently trying to set up a locuste quad, and going through all compass calibrations. In order to avoid interference, I have positioned my UBLOX GPS+compass at the very back of the quad, and up by let’s say 10cm. It seems to me like this position should be fine in terms of interference. However, I’m getting 48% compassmot in this configuration. Also, when calibrating the compass (method described by Chris A. in one of the videos), I still get some huge values for the compass offsets - some values are within -400 +400 boundaries, but one of them, sometimes 2, are huge numbers… When setting this huge offset to 0 (to be able to arm) and loitering, then of course I get the “toilet bowl”, which I guess is logical with such problems… I’m out of idea, I have tried to move the compass/GPS to the front, still up by 10cm, and it’s giving me the same results after calibration. I could raise it more, but I suspect the problem is elsewhere. Even the compass sitting on the APM will give me the same results Can anyone think about any reason why I’m getting so much interference, and why I can’t properly calibrate the compass (offsets) ? would my big motors be responsible for this big magnetic interference (when running compassmot at 50% throttle) ?

I am a specialist for our company and i am sent in to diagnose and repair problem equipment that no one else can fix. You have to have a open mind and not rule out anything until testing is done. You would be supprised when i am working on the phone with another tech and they have not tried what i have asked and when I go in and and do the tests and solve the problem. You should never be closed to an idea. That is why I said to test without blades and no load. The esc can generate noise, or the motors, or esc wires, connecters arcing.

No load on motors was only a 2 percent difference.  Now i am running a power module that gives me a clean 5 volts. Mybe that is why i get low noise.
537,"Alt-hold issue, but loiter ok",1,Could someone please tell me which sensors alt-hold uses that is different to loiter (aside from GPS) to help me troubleshoot why my loiter is rock solid but alt-hold is a mess. My baro looks like it is working great compared to the gps alt & my accZ is within range (but only just). TIA,"Hi drizi, Alt hold uses the baro exclusively for altitude determination. Loiter also uses baro for altitude determination not sure if it also mixes in GPS but I don’t think so. I think baro is used exclusively unless you have Sonar and then it switches in / out at appropriate altitude depending on SONAR model. Best Regards, Gary"

Baro actually seems to be working fine, but accel Z is not good, way too much vibration in the Z-axis. Inadequate vibration damping or something hitting the flight controller.   Interesting because X and Y look fine at plus and minus one which on the log scale equals approximately one tenth G, but the vertical Z axis is definitely not OK at plus and minus five which equals one half G. And that can screw up all the modes that use Alt Hold. Looking at your log I am pretty sure that what you need to fix is the Z axis vibration and get it down to less than + and - 2 on our log scale. (9.8 on our log scale equals 1 G).  "

TIA,"Hi Drizi, I personally favor Kyosho Zeal Gel which is stronger and comes with a high stick adhesive on both sides. But Moon Gel can be OK so long as it doesn’t get too hot. (Melts in high heat). But you are probably retaining the board too tight with the rubber band. This actually kind of needs to be tuned and my guess is that if you decrease the rubber band retention your Z vibrations will decrease. Of course if you go too far the board will move around and that isn’t good either so it is a matter of finding the best balance. It is also important to leave some slack in the wires going to your flight controller so they don’t defeat the antivibration methods. I just put in a PX4 with four 3/4"" squares of Kyosho Zeal and no additional restraint and I have sub 1/10G vibration in all 3 axes. Take a look at the antivibration wiki page I wrote for hints: *"
538,Acro not holding angle,1,"I am new to APM, coming from OpenPilot where I am used to having Rate mode configured so that, with enough I term, the copter will hold its angle, with no stick input. So far, in my attempts to tune Acro with the same quad, I cannot get this to happen. I can add Rate I, but it never really locks in, and instead slowly returns to level, and if I keep raising it, I get oscillations. This is not an autotune question, just a manual tuning one. Is this supposed to work? This is currently on 3.1rc5, and a basic 500-sized quad. Thanks in advance! [edit] just found ACRO_TRAINER set at 2 (Leveling and Limited). Will try at 0. Assuming that makes a differnce, it is truly supposed to (theoretically) hold that angle indefinitely?","Yes, that is correct.  With Trainer set to 2, it will self level.  With it set to 0, it will hold the angle tenaciously as long as you have your PIDS setup right."

540,Auto Mode Loiter_Turns How does it work?,1,"I’m trying to understand how Loiter_Turns works. I set it as index/WP 7, and am a little confused about how exactly the code is intended to work. Any help or thoughts on this would be appreciated!","I did another test today, just added one more turn (from 1 to 2), to help see what was happening. I’ll post the image later, but what I can tell, at least initially, is that a loiter turn waypoint is the place where the turn(s) should end, but the “orbit” happens with a clockwise rotation that is more or less on a tangent with the flight path. Waypoint 7 is where the turn is called. Here’s the image."

It’s odd, also, that despite the LOITER_TURNS defining a full interger for the command, if I choose 1 or 2, it only does 0.75 or 1.75 “turns”. For as clean as the regular “circle mode” has been for me (predictable, fairly consistent), it’s surprising that the tranition to the circle would have to be so messy and/or hard to (re)implement in a simlar fashion.

Unfortunately we had a catastrophic crash today in stabilize mode for no apparent reason. We tried all of the above mentioned compass fixes and nothing helped the autopilot, so we gave up on that and instead chose to fly manually, which has never been problematic in the past. Unfortunately, our drone suddenly started to drop and drift in AltHold mode, so we switched to stabilize. We had control for a few seconds and then we completely lost control of the copter, none of the failsafes kicked in, and despite all of our efforts to recover control, it crashed from 20 ft and broke more parts than we have spares for. I’m attaching the log. Here’s a graph of RollIn vs. Roll: [attachment=1]Screenshot (1) copy.jpg[/attachment] And a graph of PitchIn vs. Pitch: [attachment=0]Screenshot (2) copy.jpg[/attachment] (both of these graphs look problematic to me). Here’s a link to a video of the incident: [youtube] * [/youtube] (Unfortunately, the video cuts out milliseconds before the crash because our pilot requested that our cameraman stop filming). We would very much appreciate any insight into what caused this. We have a feeling that our drone/APM may have had software problems when we received it.

Covering own ass should not be pilots first priority, if this was a a serious situation, you can compare it to a pilot, instead of handling situation, looking for, and pulling CVR fuse. The video is the closest you have a CVR, so once you make it during testing, everybody should understand it’s role, and not be concerned about own pride.

I would very much appreciate any insight into this issue!","I see the pitch/roll variation in the log increases quickly well after takeoff, and these changes increase in amplitude prior to the mode switching and crash.  such change is usually linked to a physical “change” as something changes charasteristics due to getting loose. Once you enter land mode, throttle is reduced to all motors until desired sink rate is achieved. If you have vibrations, that could change frequency, if, like you mention; a propeller is slipping or loose, that would reduce slip and give the AP  little less “unexpected” performance to work with. Also, losing thrust on one motor on a hexa (or bigger) configuration would allow the other motors to compensate differently in different load scenarios:  example, if you loose a propeller in an overpowered hexa or octo (nominal motor hover thrust=30% ), you might barely notice, while if a machine is less powered, or nominal thrust is 70% , the others will struggle much more to compansate.  This due to the math of power duistribution, - remember than compensation for a lost motor does NOT know what motor is lost, and not only the two neighbouring motors will be affecte, the opposite motors must reduce output too, giving an asymmetric thrust distribution. Once you lose confidence in AP, your POH procedure should suggest to switch to Stabilize, and troubleshoot from there.  Stabilize is the “least advanced” mode, with only a neccessary amount of programming involved. Once you switch to “Land”, barometric sensor(or sonar) is involved. Stabilize let you “feel the machine” a bit better. On any suspicion of bad vibrations and gyro drifting caused by them, land ASAP. While I don’t see your choice of prop/mounts, threading is not really a bad problem. You should tighten well, and when using CF propellers, also use anaerobic retainer between prop and base, and top plate, not only threads.   Loctite 243 is fine."

Ch5 will be used for mode selection (modded the Taranis- S1 is now a 6 pos switch). Further more I have built my own extremely light IR trigger for my cam (smaller then the existing ones plus selection of photo / video via one channel).

547,A Few Questions about Auto,1," If taking off in Auto, what is the behavior difference when including vs excluding an Take Off command as the first line? Does the mission pause and then resume if I switch to Stablize or Acro and then back into Auto? If you define a ROI in the beginning by using a WP index, and the mission encounters a Loiter_Turns, what happens? Can I define an ROI by my arming home position? Loiter Turns: The documentation states “Will cause the craft to begin to orbit the current location when the command is invoked” Is orbit really what it does (radius?) or is it simply a rotation about the z axis? Is there a difference between a WP delay and a Loiter_Time? Can CIRCLE mode be called in an Auto mission? Between two waypoints that are close in distance but not in altitude, what is the behavior if the copter reaches the lat/long WP before reaching its defined Altitude? (caused by nav horizontal and climbing limits)  Thanks! Brit","Hi, This is what I can answer based on my experience:   Takeoff in Auto mode is only possible when the first command is takeoff, so copter takes off automatically. You can’t manually takeoff in Auto because you can’t arm the copter in Auto mode and obviously can’t control the copter with stick when it is in Auto mode. So scenario is like this: a) If first command is takeoff, then you arm your copter in Loiter or Stabilize mode, then switch to Auto mode (while on the ground!) and then move the throttle stick up (can be then move full down again), and copters takes off and continues to the mission. b) If first command is not takeoff, then arm as before, do manual takeoff using throttle and then switch to Auto on a reasonable altitude.   No. Mission will be restarted each time you switch on the Auto mode.   I think, Loiter_time is more universal, as it allows specifying a radius, while WP delay can be ignored by fixed wing (as per documentation).   WP navigation is 3D always. So copter will just fly up to the second waypoint after the altitude of the previous position is reached. I think, it wouldn’t make any sense otherwise    Happy flying!"

548,First flight using 3.1 a couple of concerns,1,"Over the New Years holiday I was able to test out my FW550 with the new AC3.1. Previously I was running I think 2.6 and had problems with it.

It would consistently land within inches of its takeoff point. However, first interesting thing. I made quite a few flights and executed the RTL just for fun. At one point the battery had run low and it went into the RTL routine on its own.  However, on subsequent flights, it would not initiate RTL upon low battery.

The other flight where it wouldn’t go to RTL on its own I was running a 3s 5000 battery. I was using an external voltage annunciator and it was sqealing but the copter didn’t RTL. The last flight it was a ways out and it started descending. I tried to recover in stabilize mode but it kept descending. I switched to RTL and it just kept descending until it hit the ground. It popped the landing gear and brushless gimbal off the frame. Any ideas? At another time while flying in Alt Hold mode abt 6 feet above ground. As I flew it away from me it started to descend. I let it go to see if it would recover. I finally stopped it when it was abt a foot off the ground. The last little bug was after several flights I landed, put in a new battery and took off. It would start to twitch like it was trying to bank to the right. It would do this several times then stop. It was in stabilize mode at the time. Has anyone else seen these little things? All in all it is a lot better than it used to be. Thanks to the Devs for all of their work. I was ready to scrap the APM for a KK2.1 board.

It is not an exposed board. I’d thought it would be fine it’s its original case. As far as the twitch goes. That’s another good point. There isn’t a good place to mount batteries on the thing. Especially since the cg changes depending upon the size of battery. I usually Velcro strap them. They appear to be tight but that’s something to review. Thanks for the input."

Is it a known bug which is still in 3.1 FW? Or maybe someone could help me telling what I’m doing wrong and provide a valid sequence? Other related questions:  Official Mavlink documentation stays that Param1 of DO_CHANGE_SPEED command is a speed type (air/ground), but ArduCopter code uses param1 as a speed value:  static void do_change_speed() { wp_nav.set_horizontal_velocity(command_cond_queue.p1 * 100); } BTW, MissionPlanner also suggests param1 is a speed value and does not tell anything about speed type.

This seems to help a little bit for DO_SET_ROI command to work properly in some situations.

Thanks.","ahanin, The do-set-speed should work but I think it will only take effect after you pass the next waypoint.  That’s not ideal but that’s the way it is at the moment.  We can probably make it take effect immediately in a future release (feel free to raise an issue on the *) although we’re quite limited on the improvements we can make for the APM2…for pixhawk the sky’s the limit. So we have “do” commands and “navigation” commands.  the do commands must always be between two navigation commands which is why you need a dummy waypoint if the “do” command is right at the end of a mission.  This was apparently done on purpose in the early days of arduplane (which was the original source of arducopter) but will certainly be resolved in a future release."

Thanks.","Hi  rmackay9, Thanks for your response. Well, I have tried a mission with a lot of waypoints and change speed is put after every waypoint (distance between waypoint is big enough), so it is always surrounded by navigation commands as needed. Every change speed command sets speed to different value, but the result is strange - few first waypoints (more than 2) are flown with default speed (i.e. WPNAV_SPEED), then somewhere in the middle of the mission speed is changed to the value of the last change speed commands and this speed then stucks even if I re-run the mission again without arming-off the copter. So complete mess, I would say… I spent days and flown almost hunderd (!) missions with different sequences and just can say that change speed command does not work almost at all. This is true for both 3.0.1 and 3.1 FW. Meanwhile, MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI command is definitely fixed in 3.1 and work flawlessly the way I expect. But even if I put change speed command before or after the MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI command, then ROI still works fine, but speed - doesn’t. And also MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW works great, even when it is mixed with ROI commands, so definitely my command sequence looks to be right and it is just change speed that does not work. I’ll then try to raise a bug about it if noone objects."

Reason i was asking is because after updating my old APM1 + HMC5843 compass  from 2.91b to AC3.1stable i got mag field warnings and couldn’t arm without disabling compass check. My compass is external with pylon and haven’t got any problems before. However i checked my tlogs from now back to year or two ago and i can always see magfield values around 600, offsets are below 100. I even took compass module out off the quad and test it in separate arduino board with quite similar results. Now i have 2 options on my mind: A. There might be a problem in my compass. I Checked local raw compass values in few different places  with different hmc5883l board + arduino and got lower readings. Also noticed that my 5843 board has some problem with 3.3V regulator, it is outputting about 3.5V which is too high. I have to look at it more. [size=85]B. As i live in Finland and we are known to have (strong?) magnetic field in vertical direction (Z-axis) and mag field strenght in my location is around 53uT (530mG) i wondered if this is part of the problem "" being on the upper edge of limits"".[/size] EDIT: Looks to be some kind of hardware problem with 5843. I tried with chinese 5883L board and mag field after live calibration was 310-335  Too bad this board doesn’t have I2C level shifter, maybe too risky to fly with this. Is it verified that AC3.1 should work ok with 5843, if i’m right there’s nothing big difference in setup between 43 and 83L except Gain and sensitivity?"

When the 3.3V regulator outputs 5V there’s a real problem but 3.5V is probably ok. So I think the problem here is that the 5843 outputs a larger value so that’s upsetting the pre-arm checks.

Do you guy any idea? or share your experience! ) Merry Christmas!!!","Normally descent in Loiter is caused by the throttle not being in the middle.  It sound silly but tons of people make this mistake because the mid throttle position while hovering in a manual flight mode (stabilize) is different than when in Loiter or AltHold.  The mid-position while in the manual flight modes can be adjusted by following the instructions on *. Now did the copter actually disarm after it landed?  If it’s in Loiter mode it should only disarm if it thinks it’s landed and the pilot has put the throttle at zero for about 15 seconds.  The other possibility is that the MOT_SPIN_ARMED parameter is set to zero so then it will shut down the motors when it thinks it’s landed but it won’t actually disarm (if you raised the throttle above mid it would restart the motors and take off). The reason that this difference is that it tells whether it was in Loiter or whether a failsafe had triggered.  It would only have disarmed if a failsafe had triggered and it was in LAND mode. …but you know…instead of all this guess work, it would be better to attach logs file…"

Greetings, Ender","Hi, Just a quick thought, You can adjust the dead-band center point with the THR-MID parameter, but I dont think you can adjust altitude hold manual response rate in the APM/Pixhawk. But you likely can by adjusting expo on your throttle on your RC transmitter. If you are currently using throttle expo on your transmitter that has the effect of increasing the dead-band and decreasing initial altitude change response outside of it. On most transmitters you can actually put in reverse expo and get it to load more of the rate of change to the center of the throttle area. This will cause the dead-band to be smaller and the rate of altitude change to be quicker - sooner. Of course it will change throttle response for all other modes as well so use this method conservatively.  Best Regards, Gary"

Greetings, Ender","Hi Stefan and ender, Yes you can adjust both THR_ALT and THR_RATE parameters, but adjustments to either of them are primarily to permit you to affect the altitude hold automatic responsiveness and they simply coincidentally also affect the manual override throttle rate. Basically if the auto throttle rate is too low, (sluggish) you can increase the rate and it will also increase the manual response rate. But primarily you really just want to have these values tuned to do the best possible job of automatically maintaining your current altitude without regard to altitude hold manual override rate response. And preferably fix any manual override discrepancies by other means. Ideally, adding a manual override rate parameter and a dead-band size parameter could provide a more universal solution at an infinitesimal    cost in firmware CPU cycles or memory space."

So i am trying to safe my investments and worked on Failsafe mode. I DO have a Turnigy 9x but the missing Failsafe capability has been compenated for by a cheap failsafe module on Throttle channel. So i tried it out. Set Failsafe to RTL, waited for GPS fix, started and switched off remote… The Hexa came back to launch position, hovering in the desired 15m (now i set that to 25m due to very tall trees around). But it lotered “forever” (waited 20secs as i found the value to be set to 5000 msecs = 5 secs before it SHOULD land). The final heigth was set to “0” so in my usnderstanding it should try to land.

I found ths other thread dealing with the very same problem: * I tried out the advised workaround and it worked, although my craft looked a bit nervous while landing.

I suspect that the issue is caused by your capacity, as it occurs as the maH value crosses 840 - so maybe some unit confusion somewhere? I can’t easily test at the moment. PARM, BATT_CAPACITY, 8400.000 As to why it changed to RTL, it seems in AUTO it ignores the specified failsafe and does this instead: so thats probably why you ended up in RTL. In other modes it checks the failsafe_battery_enabled type to either RTL or LAND (or LAND in the case RTL mode selection fails). Why its written that way, I’m not sure."

562,Arducopter GPS loss and fly away,1,"Hi folks, Few days ago, I was testing my new build. I made a small waypoint mission. First time i did it, everything worked fine. After few hours, i attempted the same mission again. I took off in stabilize, then switched to loiter for few seconds to test the position hold. The position was held relatively well. There was quite some wind…about 20 Kph. I later switched to stabilized, gained some altitude then switched to auto. The Hex flew towards waypoint 1 then suddenly flew away very fast. It flew with the wind and got caught up on a tall thorny tree. I lost 4 props. Everything else was ok. Im quite new to APM, i have been trying to analyse the dataflash log file. I can see APM lost GPS satellites before flying away. My question are: Could anything that i set up wrongly have been the cause of the GPS  satelite loss? What is the best option for GPS failsafe?

I have one broken board on input pin/channel no.3, is there any chance to map the THR input to another input pin? Thanks in advance for your support. waladi",* * I had a problem like that when i got a board from china. Turns out the surface mount resistor was not fully solder to the board. Follow the input from channel three to the small surface mount resistor. Use a small wire to bypass the resistor. Go from the large input connector on the board to the inside edge of the surface mount resistor. Have someone help you do the check with you. They can move the throttle to see if the input changes on the mission planner. I have a solder work station and i was able to fix the input on 2 of my inputs. Cheap Chinese board.

565,"Receiver stops working on subsequent power, can't arm quad",1,"Have had good experience with APM v2.5x and installed one of my fresh APM v2.5 boards (assuming it is 2.5.2 since it was purchased right before 2.6 was released) on a new quadcopter (frame printed from a 3D printer). I had to update the PPM encoder firmware and this was first, then I installed APM v2.5 and GPS and telemetry with a Spektrum AR7010 receiver.  Went to radio calibration and was able to get the radio calibrated, and was also successful in accelerometer calibration and compass calibration. Got the motors to spin and the new slow spinning motors on arming is neat.  Watched the motors turn on and off and was able to spin them up. My issue: after powering-down the APM v2.5 (with FW v3.1 on it and new PPM firmware), the radio no longer responds, so I cannot arm the quadcopter.  The issue is solved only during while power is applied; when I kill power and reapply, the receiver shows a linked connection but nothing is responded to on the GCS software. My solution (so far):  The only thing I can do to get the radio to respond is to preform an accelerometer calibration routine again; then, the radio works like expected and the motors arm and spin, etc.  However, after cycling power, I no longer have access to the radio until I perform an accelerometer calibration. I have tried to erase the EEPROM–same results.  The wizard likes to get stuck on some attempts when the radio is stuck, but I was able to get through the whole wizard installation with all green boxes, thinking that maybe a wizard active flag was stuck in the APM’s EEPROM. Other things I have tried was to go to advanced PID full parameter list and “write” the parameters, thinking somehow the accelerometer calibration didn’t stick. Subsequent radio calibrations fail since the radio parameters are all at one level and don’t change.  I repeat that the only thing I’ve found was to re-perform an accelerometer calibration.  How can I get this to stick so that APM knows that it’s okay to go? Thanks, Scott",it could be some kind of hardware fault.  what would be good is an rlog from the mission planner or you could try connecting through the terminal window or the arduino serial monitor.

Aaaaand- it accelerated doing so… Why- easy- it “thought” if flies towards the correct point, error increased, it accelerated… The external compass I used was EXACTLY 180 deg Yaw off- this explains why just going straight and increasing banking with distance! So did I the correct 180 deg Yaw setting and now it works sooooo nice! We have a little wind today but still it held position within a meter or so!! Will test the GeoFence feature soon but expect it to work as good as the rest does! If the glitch protection also works I guess this is a huge safety improvement for those long range FPV flight nobody does  Kind regards and thanks a lot! Roman"

Thanks for any help.","The only thing I can think of is that you are using a wrong MODE setting please refer to the manual to set the mode in nothing else than STABALIZE mode In for example Loiter mode, the copter might respond to your control sticks but also might go “it’s own way” You claim you are not using GPS. If not using GPS, the copter will not just rize to 15m, but will also drift away with the wind. I guess that although you think you are not using GPS, in fact you are. Connect the APM via USB or radio link/USB and connect In setup, check your radio switches setting and see if indeed you are using STABALIZE as your mode. This is the ONLY mode to start flying in. good luck, OctoFly_Hilversum"

569,Tricopter yaw single oscillation after input,1,"Hi All, I’m relatively new here (but have been lurking for ages). 1st, thanks to all the devs and contributors for making ardupilot so awesome!! 2nd, I’ve got a question about tricopter yaw tuning. I have been flying a homebrew tricopter for about 6months with 3.0.1, and had it flying well except that when yawing - it would overcorrect a single time after a movement. I just updated to 3.1 and am having a similar issue. The tri is rock solid, and needs a bit of stick input to initiate yaw, and then it will yaw appropriately (maybe a little on the fast side) and when I release the stick it will do a single oscillation in the opposite direction, then it will stay rock-solid again on the new heading. The yaw mechanism is the simple-copter tail block design and there is very little slack in the mechanism, and I think it is a PID issue. Is there any documentation on using/tuning the yaw on tricopters? I can’t seem to resolve this by just randomly adjusting settings. Is there a procedure to tune the yaw to get a steady response, or is there some documentation of each PID value with respect to yaw? Cheers for any help.","I’ll take a stab at an answer as I’ve just gone through a long process of getting a tricopter dialed in. Without knowing what your current P, I and D values are, I’ll speak in generalities. The fact you have an overshoot suggests your yaw P is either too high or you have a low yaw D. The P value is sort of how fast the tricopter corrects to your desired new position and the D value moderates the overshoot. If P is low, you don’t get much overshoot but the response is slow. If P is high, response is very quick but you’ll get lots of overshoot. Adding in a little D allows you to use a higher P, for quick response, but reduces the overshoot. From your description it sounds like your yaw P is either OK or on the high side. I’d play with the D value. If it’s set to zero, not uncommon for tris, you could add in a very small amount and see what happens. I’m running a D of .003 with a P of .230, but my tri may be nothing like yours. You can also put your yaw D on Channel 6 tuning, adjust the value while it’s flying and try different values. Be careful about not jumping to too high a D value because it can cause rapid oscillations and control becomes difficult. D should be pretty small. A cautious approach for D tuning, if it’s currently at zero, would be to set your channel 6 knob to vary D from .001 to .005. *  that has a decent PID discussion."

Doesn’t look like the file attachment took, so here is the link to the log: *","I can answer part of your question, I think. The part I can’t answer is why your quad started climbing. For most of your flight the barometric altitude matched the GPS altitude perfectly. Then, for no obvious reason the quad thought your GPS altitude started dropping. The divergence from the baro altitude is just amazing. So it started adding power to the motors (throttle out). The baro altitude shows the result was that quad started to climb, but the GPS altitude showed it dropping. What’s strange is this doesn’t match with any substantial GPS glitching as your HDOP and number of satellites were OK at that time. Possibly GPS interference I suppose. Now as to why it fell out of the sky, that’s obvious in the attached plot. Your throttle in is in blue and what the APM actually sent to the motors is in pink. When you were in loiter mode and the quad was climbing you lowered the throttle all the way to zero in an attempt to get it to stop climbing. And you know the throttle works differently in Alt Hold and Loiter modes. I like to think of it as merely a desired climb rate. But when you switched back to Stabilize your throttle in was at zero which shut off your motors. Just after this happened large pitch and roll attitudes were recorded. AKA, the falling leaf effect. When switching out of Alt Hold or Loiter modes you almost always want to return your throttle to mid position just before making the changeover. We all make that mistake at least once, with varying consequences. After that, it’s burned into our brains. You were probably more unfortunate than most, but I doubt you’ll make that same mistake again."

That’s a pretty reasonable analysis, but there is one important thing: The value “RelAlt” is actually not the GPS altitude at all. This is the output from the Baro-Inertial fusion algorithm.  So what happened here is probably a standard vibration-induced flyaway.  The vibration aliases onto accelerometer signal and drives down the estimated altitude, then the throttle controller responds by increasing throttle. The solution is to do a better job reducing vibration on the board. There is a data line in the GPS logging, I think it’s “GPS Alt” or something.  This is the actual GPS reported altitude, but the program does not use this in any way, it’s purely for information in the logs."

580,Compass settings,1,"Merry Chrismas guys, i’ve a compass issue with firmware V 3.1 on my old (standard) APM 1.4. After compass calibrating is is never showing exactly north (compared with a magnetic compass). There is a difference of approx 15 degree. However, i tried a flight in simple mode. After takeoff, i noticed a small continous yaw but the quad was stable in the air and the feeling for the trottle was really great. Possibly i did a mistake when calibrating in mission planner. Which compass type i shouldchoose (intern, extern, manual and which orientation)?","Volker, The heading that shows up in the mission planner is true north instead of magnetic north.  The difference will come from the declination which will be automatically looked up from an internal lookup table using the GPS location. *"

582,Few issues,1,"Hey Guys, I’m new to the RC world, just built my first quad and got a couple of issues, was hoping some of you quad pros could help me out to see what I’ve configured wrong / issues with parts. 1 - When in stabilize mode and trying to hover on the spot, the quad always drifts left… not too much as I can counter it fairly easily. 2 - Loiter mode forces my quad to fly towards the top left, altitude is sort of maintained but hard to tell. 3 - Probably the most concerning out of the 3, quad gets ‘stuck’ in its last direction for a split second then its fine.

Did you calibrate the accels/gyros? If the APM is not mounted 100% perfectly parallel to the flight plane and the accels/gyros are not calibrated, it will drift, because Arducopter always levels the controller, not the quad.

586,Do flight modes overrule one another?,1,"My scenario is as follows:  I have one three position switch set up to select from flight modes Stabilize, Alt Hold, and Loiter.  I want to set Auto and RTL on channels 7 and 8 respectively.  If I invoke RTL on channel 8 will it override whatever other selections are made on the other switches/channels when it is activated? including Auto should that be activated on channel 7?  Or, will I need to turn Auto off on channel 7 before RTL will be invoked on channel 8? I could create a six position mix on my 9303, but should there be an issue while flying it would be great to just hit the “Red” switch, as it were, and have my craft return home without fiddling or worrying about being in the wrong switch position, mode, etc. Thanks in advance, and have a nice holiday season.","OK, well I did some lab testing with the Mission Planner, and it would appear that whenever RTL is invoked on Channel 8 (in my case) it will override everything else, auto, loiter, etc.  However, if you are in RTL and invoke Auto, it will change the mode to Auto and start the mission.  To re-invoke RTL it is necessary to toggle it off then on again, basically resetting the command.  Same holds true for Auto mode… so the switches are basically ignored until they are invoked again. So it would be important, therefor, to not flick any switches after RTL is turned on, if the point of using it is to get out of trouble and get the craft back. Should I have made some error in my thinking here, please don’t hesitate to let me know (as I am sure you won’t)."

The main reason is that in ALTH mode, the throttle doesn’t control the RPM any more but it tells the copter how fast you want to climb or sink. Means, with the copter on the ground, every throttle position below center is meaningless, because the copter just can’t sink any further than sitting on the ground. As soon as you pull above center, the motors spin up and if you are not really really careful, the copter will rocket upwards, because - again - you are not commanding RPM but climb rate, so you have to be much more sensitive with the stick. That’s mainly a matter of getting used to it and practising it a few times."

When you can’t do this calibration, activate the Motors log in the APM. You can then check if all motors are controlled with the same value. If not, it’s a APM thing.

I do the same for current measurement by using a turnigy wattmeter installed between my battery and the PDB (plugs in series between your battery and the connector of your PDB). I then spin the motors so as to read about 10 amps on the wattmeter and I copy the value (for ex 9.89 or 10.06) onto the measured current value in mission planner (battery monitor/Other). There too there is a bit of unprecision but it is unavoidable.Anyway I just consider the displayed amp value as a rough indication of the consumption and I DO NOT use it to trigger a battery low event. I only base the battery failsafe on the voltage reading which I trust a bit more than the current reading. This is my experience and it might be different for others. Hopes it helps"

615,Bounces during Auto Land,1,"Hi, When I use Auto Land, like RTL, the quad will touch down correctly but then lifts again, sets down, lifts again, sets down etc. It does this between 1-3 times before it will settle on the ground and reduce the power to the motors. My Throttle stick is always low before it touches down in auto land. So that couldn’t be the problem. I use the APM 2.6 with V3.1-rc7 firmware. My TBS Discovery Pro is quite well tuned. I used the Auto Tune option in V3.1-rc7. I really recommend it. Also I use the V Frame setting at Mission Planner. It is a big difference to my tuning attempts. So if anyone has an idea what causes the bouncing, I would really appreciate it a lot. Thanks, Steven","Hi Steven, I would suggest lowering the LAND_SPEED parameter shown on this page: * It is possible that when your copter sets down, ground effect / turbulence is causing it to balloon back up and as the copter has to detect minimal movement for 1 second before it will turn off the motor, it isn’t actually realizing it has touched down until the ballooning oscillations get small enough. Lowering the LAND_Speed parameter a bit should help because it should reduce the ballooning tendency. The TBS is generally a fairly light and powerful copter so this kind of over correction is likely. Best Regards, Gary"

615,Bounces during Auto Land,4,"Hi, When I use Auto Land, like RTL, the quad will touch down correctly but then lifts again, sets down, lifts again, sets down etc. It does this between 1-3 times before it will settle on the ground and reduce the power to the motors.

Thanks, Steven","This is just a thought, but landings are detected by observing reduced change in altitude, it is possible when you get to the ground your prop wash might create a condition of pressure change at the baro and that is what the throttle is trying to compensate for. If so that would be easy to see in the logs. If you look at the baro right while trying to actually land does it do anything (unlikely) right before and during that bounce period, like spike up or down a bit?"

Thanks, Steven","Hi Gary, I viewed my logs and it seems that the baro parameter goes below 0 and even down to -6 when the copter touches down. Therefore the APM thinks the copter is falling, faster than the LAND_SPEED, and increases the throttle to get back to the set LAND_SPEED which in my case is 50 m/sec. I think this is the reason of the bouncing. The reason why the baro goes so low on touch down is because the APM is located below the the props between the upper and the lower frame plate. Also the TBS Discovery has very short legs and sinks into the gras down to it’s lower frame plate. APM is as good as level to the ground. So the props causing a high pressure turbulence at the baro sensor. I think this is also causing the problems with the oscillations at ALT HOLD and LOITER as I mentioned before. Because the copter is flying the turbulences are not so strong as at landing. Do you think there is a possibility to fix this with changing some parameters ? If yes, what parameter would it be ? If not I would try to eigther place the APM higher on the top frame plate and/or make longer legs so the copter won’t sink in and the air can flow beneath it or seal the APM air tight and only attach a tube to it which goes up to a point higher than the props are. What would be your thought on this ? Best regards, Steven"

The bad news is that even if you could compensate a bit for it in firmware by adjusting PIDs it would likely be an inadequate solution. The baro really needs uncompromised air to work properly. It takes relatively little prop wash back pressure to make a considerable difference in perceived altitude. I have had turbulence / baro problems myself. I strongly suggest moving the APM to that top frame plate, but in any case, some solution that gets the baro away from propwash / turbulence in the air and on the ground. I probably need to emphasize this a bit more in the wiki. Best Regards, Gary"

I have put warnings about this in several spots in the wiki. Now that auto land is a reasonable option and RTL I think this is going to be a common problem and the only real solution is to have the flight controller in such a position and configuration that it is not much affected by the prop-wash."

616,"""continue with mission"" failsafe, but not in Auto mode?",1,"“Continue with mission” is a failsafe mode I’ve actually used with success when intentionally flying very briefly behind a hill where I knew I’d lose RC link. But what happens when one is in, say, Altitude Hold flight mode and have a failsafe?  Does the “mission” that is continued equal the mission that is flashed under Auto mode, or is it to continue to hold the flight mode one is in, or something else?","From the wiki: [i]When a throttle failsafe is triggered one of the following will happen:  Disarm motors – if you are in stabilize or acro mode and your throttle is zero RTL – if you have a GPS lock and are at least 2 meters from your home position LAND – if you have no GPS lock or are within 2 meters of home when the failsafe triggers Continue with the mission – if you are in AUTO mode and have set the Failsafe Options to “Enabled_continue_in_auto_mode”. If the failsafe clears (throttle climbs back above 975) the copter will remain in it’s current flight mode. - - It will not automatically return to the flight mode that was active before the failsafe was triggered. This means that if, for example, you are flying in stabilize mode when the failsafe is triggered, and this causes the flight mode to change to RTL or LAND, if you wish to re-take control of the copter you will need to change your flight mode switch to another position and then back again to Stabilize.[/i]  So it sounds like it will LAND if in ALT_HOLD and enters failsafe."

Also, I’m afraid that I’ve connected the radio receiver incorrectly to the APM, as for the instructions it says that for ppm only one cable + jumper should be connected, but I dont see the way to do so with my receiver so I connected the by using the provided cable. I’ve added two photos as the issue might be there. Here a video, which I made to ilustrate other issue I’m having with two ESC, but notice that when the engines are stopped I’m holding the stick to itw lowest position. * My radio is this one: Turnigy 9XR Transmitter Mode 2 * My module: FrSky DF 2.4Ghz Combo Pack for JR w/ Module & RX * I would appreciate some help because I’m stuck.",SOLVED  configure the mix as in this video and issue will be gone. I’m such a rookie with this stuff…
627,Define Tricopter when uploading from ardupilot arduino IDE,1,"Hi… i usually upload new firmwares from ardupilot arduino IDE since i have some minor modifications in my GitHub Fork. I have my apm 2.5 on a tricopter and need to define FRAME_CONFIG TRI_FRAME in APM_Config.h Just above the frame definition it says: // If you used to define your CONFIG_APM_HARDWARE setting here, it is no longer // valid! You should switch to using a HAL_BOARD flag in your local config.mk. i dont have a config.mk So how do i do that? and Why is there no option for defining a tricopter in the FRAME Parameter? for example 4= Tricopter","* * i might have misunderstood her… I assume that CONFIG_APM_HARDWARE is the Hardware version of the APM board it self (APM1,AMP2,APM2.5/2.6) but still… Is there another way of defining tricopter frame than in the source code? I also have another quick question to add. My tricopter don’t seem to hold it’s heading the way i would assume. When i fly backwards fast it tends to rotate one way or another due to air drag. If i stop the copter the Yaw auto controller doesn’t restore the previous heading… in other words it seems that the yaw is not trying to get back to its “SET” Compass Heading (i’m not moving the yaw stick out of it’s deadband.) My settings: -MAG_ENABLE=1 -AHRS_YAW_P=0.4 (default 0.1) -AHRS_GPS_USE=1 -AHRS_GPS_GAIN=1 (Not well documented parameter) Some places is s written that it is for the altitude and other places attitude"

It appears that my battery monitor configuration was not setup and the voltage was not showing up. Once I configured the battery monitor correctly, the correct voltage showed up. I still only get 0 amps of current until I turn on the motors, but maybe that is because the APM draws so little current. I wonder why the rc2 version worked?"

631,Position-based flight modes,1,"I’m coming from the NAZA-M world and the one thing that I would really like now that I’m switching to ArduCopter is a flight mode just like NAZA’s GPS mode. In this mode, when you let go of the sticks it stays in the same spot. When you move the sticks, it flies at constant attitude in the direction you command, automatically adjusting for wind so that it doesn’t fly backwards if you don’t push the stick far enough. When you let go of the sticks again, it gradually slows down then comes to a standstill and stays in that new position. It’s very easy to fly and very intuitive.

632,Switchable Loiter Mode,1,"Is it possible to set one of my switches to turn on/off loiter mode?  Instead of once it hits a certain PWM speed it is initialized. Hexacopter, arducopter. Thank you","Yes, you can assign modes to your switches in the “Configuration/Tuning” -> “Flight Modes” section of the mission planner. You can assign different modes for different outputs.  With a 2 way switch you can set one to stabilize and one to Loiter (Or one to stabilize, one to Auto in my case).  If you have additional switch positions, you can assign them to different modes. If you have the APM connected and the transmitter/reciever on, you will see the currently selected mode in green. Hope this helps… Josh"

634,APM/DX7s,1,Hi guys First time I’ve posted so her goes. Just upgraded quad from Crius V2 to APM 2.52.

I’ve tried a new model and downloaded Peter Kings DX7s set up file to sd card. Still no change. Found mix setting on DIY Drones and changed to them but still no more flight modes I’m not techy minded so am now completely baffled. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Any ideas? / Gustaf","*, I am using a Spektrum satellite receiver with my PX4 FMU/IO board. To get my R/C transmitter to bind to the satellite, I hooked the satellite to a standard master Spetkrum receiver that uses a satellite input and bound the two to the transmitter. I then disconnected the satellite from the master receiver and hooked it to the PPM input of the PX4 FMU/I/O. When I started up the PX4 with the R/C transmitter on, the satellite linked to the transmitter and I was able to calibrate the transmitter in the MP CLI. Regards, TCIII"
