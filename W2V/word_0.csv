You seem to have some experience so I assume you’ve already done that and checked the logs. For the flaps some of them could be reversed (ones pointing at the camera), not sure though. The response when rotating the copter doesn’t seem that wrong, test the yaw first because it’s obvious when something is wrong with it. (from memory) Most of the Pitch/Roll correction from the flaps will be visible when the copter has a rotational speed. Also the copter sits on the table armed for quite a while, so some of the I from the PIDs could make interpreting the movement difficult, you can set I to 0 and test without."

In singlecopter the ailerons are configured as motors, but they are servos, so if the protocol is PWM everything is fine, but if it is Dshot they no longer work, and the thrust motor does. I don’t know if it is possible to choose a separate protocol for the motors inside ArduPilot, servo_protocol for the thrust motor in Dshot and servo_protocol for PWM ailerons. That would be a solution to implement. The alternative is to use an ESC that runs under PWM. I’ll see if I can find one, and check if that would be a solution. On the other hand, could someone give a more concise explanation about what should be the movement of the ailerons according to pitch, roll and yaw?"

The conclusions for new ones who want to make this model is that it is very unstable in the wind, the center of mass is too high. But it’s a lot of fun! that’s true. Use a T-Motor VELOX V2306 at 2400kv, otherwise I am sure it will burn it out. I burned the first engine, the latter is doing very well.

I’m excited to see what will happen with Ardupilot on it. Be careful to not fall for the * by saying that. The height of the CoM does not impact stability much, and higher (further from the flaps) is better for the single copter frame (creates higher torque). If you had something else in mind, I’d be interested to here what causes the higher instability."

I initially used betaflight but due to my really bad flying skills I needed to add althold mode so switched to ardupilot. I just completed my first flight using ardupilot, and it went pretty well. Although due to the wind it kept getting blown off course and I was unable to correct it so had to dump it several times in the long grass. I am working on improving my flying skills by using a simulator and I bought a small quad which uses the same transmitter to learn on. I think the Alt hold will help me a lot once I get it working properly as then I can just concentrate on hovering in one place using pitch and roll and not have to also control the throttle. I have certainly learnt a lot and am now fully addicted to this hobby. Building this monodrone as my first experience probably wasn’t the smartest idea, and now I realize there is so much to learn (motors, props FCs, ESCs etc etc). I 3D printed initially with PLA, but every time I crashed, the top frame snapped around the motor. I then tried PLA+ and super tough PLA, but it always snaps at the weak spot where the spars join the center motor mount. I am currently redesigning this top frame to beef up that area. (I’ll stick it on thingiverse if it works). I used a recommended motor eventually after failing to get it to work with some cheap 2212 2240Kv motors, I ended up using	Racerstar Racing Edition 2306 BR2306S 2700KV and gemfan 6042-3 props, this seems to allow it to hover at about mid throttle with 3S 1300mAH batteries. As I was trying to do this on a budget I used an Olimex STM32F405 board I had lying around and made some PCBs to handle the connections to the servos and external sensors. As I am an experienced micro programmer I had no trouble building Ardupliot for this custom platform. (although if I ever get it to fly reliably I may splash out on a real FC). I’m hoping the next flight, when there is no wind, may stay in the air for more than a few seconds   I did notice that when I tried to roll away from the wind it got unstable, probably was saturating the servos, I have a log recorder so I need to analyze those logs. It does like to drift in various directions even without wind. I used 2lian PIDs to start with, but would certainly like to see if anyone has well tuned pids for this model of monocopter. I can’t keep it in the air long enough at the moment to reliably tune them. Anyone else using arducopter for this monocopter?"
3,What parameters control Position radius or hover accuracy in auto modes?,1,"Need it for a stable hover. I know about WPNAV_RADIUS - does it also control the radius above any point that sticks are released in Loiter, Land, and the final RTL stage? Since this parameter is not working for me too well, are there other parameters I should look into?","Take a look at PID tuning, including rate, angle and position PIDs. There is a total of 11 PID controllers, all 11 have influence on the hover accuracy in auto modes."

What about  WPNAV_RADIUS ? - Does it control the allowable XY error for hovering in Loiter when sticks are released (also in Land)? Or is it used exclusively when flying a pre-planned mission from waypoint to waypoint?"

When loitering, the vehicle tries its best to hold its position. As * said, PID and PSC-related parameters influence the loitering performance directly. Basically, PID values are used to stabilize the vehicle on-air (achieve desired angles, accelerations etc.) while PSC parameters are used to (on top of PID) hold the vehicle in the desired position."

4,I'd like to work with a developer of Arducopter software,1,"Over the last 4 years I have been making no progress. In fact every new copter and every new software upgrade makes my copters perform worse and worse. It may be that the new software becomes more and more complex with more parameters that need to be carefully addressed. Since I’m not an expert in Arducopter software, before I throw a towel, I’d like to work with a developer who is working on the single-copter software. Perhaps it would benefit both of us as I can provide some valuable data. Below is a short history along with log files from the latest flights. I achieved nice and stable flights with Arducopter v3.4  Almost rock solid hover over a point and nice, slow and straight landings. That was 4 years ago and a video of my first copter in Loiter and RTL modes is below. There was quite a breeze. Unfortunately no log:      The latest tests from today are below. It’s the latest copter and software (v4.2). I did it in my backyard to protect the copter from any wind. All I wanted was to get to 2 m, hover over one point and land. All loiter and land or RTL. As you can see it will not hold position or attitude. Every switching to Land or RTL results with weird behavior. It usually descends much faster than years ago although the land speed is the same (30 cm/s). It will jump up before descending, go sideways, and the attitude log is very much a jig saw. I will switch to v3.6 to compare, but before I do that I wanted to post what I got to date. Quick Loiter and Land modes video: * Log: * Attempt to hover over a point; it dropped down by itself: * Attempt to hover and quick RTL: * Combined log for both: *","Bit unrelated but, is it only the GPS modes that are broken ? I’m saying this because I also struggled with my GPS (though there was a major bug on mine so I’m not sure). Later when I configured a quad with the same components, the pitch-roll axis I used for the single copter were reversed compared to what I was now using for the quad (and the quad GPS modes now worked fine). Commands on the radio controller were doing exactly the opposite movement as to what was happening on the single when in manual and AltHold. I am still very confused about that and could never troubleshoot it. Maybe I fucked up the setup of my single, and you somehow did the same (maybe there is a problem in the documentation and or the code that makes the roll-pitch reversed). I want to add that on my single, the attitude displayed in missionplanner was right, North was North, pitching down (arrow on the computer pointed down) was down, right was right. The flaps were acting accordingly (I mean, it was flying if that’s not proof). Same thing on that quad, everything was the same, except the stick of the radio. (also triple checked the radio config at the time, no major changes on there) All of this confused rambling by myself to say that maybe, there’s a strange thing on what pitch-roll means and the GPS is confused. If you have a quad on hand you could compare."

5,Minimum motor PWM after take off,1,"I need to set a minimum PWM for the motor that it will not go below after take off. Is there a way to do that?

I would advise against using such a thing for manual control though, if you set it too high you could send your copter to space with no way to bring it down (safely). Such small error can happen very fast, you remove a camera or change the battery, forget about the setting, and your copter goes to heaven. If this features does not exist and the devs want to implement it (it’s quite usefull for the single/coax), we would need some safety to bring the copter back down."

You know this situation real well yourself from you own work. I have finally ended up with a single copter that’s ultra light and efficient. It has a chance of staying in the air for 20+ minutes. The copter uses 12"" prop that spins quite slowly so the air flow over flaps is low. Its is very controllable at hoover, but the moment the motor PWM drops 100 below hoover PWM the flaps lose their authority, will not recover even if throttle is increased, and it crashes. For the flaps to be effective at 100 PWM below hoover they would have to be gigantic. I tried that but it is not feasible. Adds too much bottom weight and size. I thought that limiting motor rpm would be the solution but I must agree with you - it may create a potential fly away hazard. Dave just advised about the MOT_SPIN_MIN parameter that would need to be set just below hoover. If not MOT_SPIN_MIN, what other parameters could I use for all the modes? Would PILOT_SPEED_DN be the parameter? If so, will it work in ALT_Hold, Loiter and Stabilize? It must also work in RTL and Land modes. There is a PILOT_ACCEL_Z parameter. Does it work in both directions and in all modes? I however would not want to limit speed and accel in the up direction. For the final stage of RTL I think I can rely on LAND_SPEED and LAND_SPEED_HIGH but that will not work during normal flight. Any thoughts on that?"

Single copter with a small 5-6"" propeller is not a problem. They fly really nicely and stable because they make a lot of air flow over the flaps. What’s challenging is landing and sometimes take-off. At take off and landing the flaps have the opposite effect to that after airborne because at least one of the legs is “anchored” to the ground and so the copter cannot move the tail for balancing. Because the copter is virtually weightless at that moment, and with high center of gravity, the force from the flaps make the copter fall sideway. Best would be to disable flaps until the copter is a few centimeters above the ground, that is until it is free to move the tail for balancing. The same at landing. Automatically disable them just before touch down. What I do - I kill the motor if I remember. During take-off, you must take-off quite fast to let the flaps do the job. This is a serious problem. One should be able to take-off and land slow and gently. Especially with a large single copter. Another problem is having any side ways speed vector during landing. Because of the high center of gravity, any side speed makes the copter fall over. There is always some wind, so manual slow landing practically always ends up with a fall. This is why I practically always land in auto mode (Land or RTL). These modes make the copter land perfectly vertically even in windy conditions. Optical flow sensor here works really well. It’s just like landing a helicopter - no sideway speed allowed. Unfortunately these small single copters don’t stay in air for too long. In my case just about 2 minutes. This is why I built this next ultra light and larger version. Same weight but prop is twice the diameter. The power draw is a quarter of a small copter. It hovers at a very low throttle. I just did not expect that even large flaps would quickly lose their authority at throttle level just below hover. You make it descent too fast and it goes into resonance and crashes. I tested many different styles of flaps (on a test rig). The conclusion is always the same: they need to be unreasonably large to work well at very low throttle settings. An alternative is to use a very heavy battery on top of the copter, which kind of defeats the purpose. In my opinion single copters are fine, except for landing them safely. They are really fun."

I would absolutely love to see videos (and logs) with your explanations and frequent updates (I sadly can’t have fun with building one for the next few years so…). Maybe it could even inspire more people to build a single copter on this community To solve the touch-down / take-off issue, the only thing I see is having the flaps above the center of mass. But you’ll have to start a brand new single-copter design to achieve that (could be much better than what we are used to, idk). For the flaps authority, it really seems like you’ve reached the limit. I don’t know what your design looks like exactly but here are two ideas:  ducting the flow grid design (so basically, having more than 4 flaps)  I would love to see a grid design, I think it could have some insane performances to weight, especially on big single-copters.

I try not to as I find they generate more drag, and consequently reduce flight time. They are heavier too. In my tests I see that they generate only about 30% more torque than the lighter and longer planar fins. Attached is a picture of a fin that I will use in my next copter. Shrouded propeller is a bit more efficient, but I find that the extra weight is not worth it. I started with shrouded, but now I also use open propellers. I did experiment with flaps on top, also flaps on top and at the bottom. The problem is that the top flaps must still be placed below the propeller. That means that the motor and servos are placed very high. This forces the top flaps to have to swing a lot of mass. In my case they take-off nicely, hover for a moment, but get into resonance and crash. The top flaps are not able to cope with the large inertia at the top. In case of top and bottom flaps, the bottom flaps can’t cope with the low center of gravity (because of the centrally placed battery) and low air flow (being so far down from the prop). I had better luck replacing flaps with 4 small motors and propellers on top of the copter, with propeller shafts horizontal. You can use bi-directional motors or variable pitch props. That however was a lot of added mass that created no lift, just side forces. The frames flew quite well. They would cope with lending while having some lateral speed but the power draw was huge. Because of that the flight time was only about 1 minute. My specialty is internal combustion engines, so my primary goal always was to develop larger, gas powered drones. For gasoline engines I find single copter to be the most logical type of frame. The electric copters I build are only stepping stones as they are a million times simpler to work with, and cost less after I crush them. Unfortunately, I am not a pro in using Arducopter software, so I really struggle with it. There are hundreds of useful commands and settings that would make it all work well, but I don’t even know about their existence. I only learn about them when I crush and look for solutions. It takes me almost a year to rebuild a gas powered copter, so it is no fun. That’s why any help I get on this forum is priceless for me. I can see several ways of improving take-offs and landings but they can only be implemented in larger gasoline drones than those I’m working on at the moment. Cheers!"

That’s a very nice grid you got there, and it’s very true that it will create drag hadn’t thought of that. Have you ever considered having each flaps of the grid with its own rotation axis, instead of all being in one part? The thing with grids is that they take a lot of space if made in one piece. I think a first copter with 2-3 (time 4) flaps, each on its own axis would be possible. Those would be closer to the prop pushing the airflow inside easily generating more torque and less drag.

I agree that the flaps should have an airfoil profile. I like the one you used in your copter. I did use airfoil for some of my single flaps, but they were much flatter profiles than yours. In fact I was in a process of switching to your profile. In my grid flaps the center flap has an airfoil to it. A shallow airfoil though. The side plates are flat with rounded leading edges. I wanted to avoid air compression between adjacent airfoils. I remembered from fluid dynamics classes that plates placed too close to each other, at certain air speeds generate drag almost as large as a plank of the width that equals the distance between those plates. If they have an airfoil shape the compression may stop airflow between them at lower speeds yet. Not sure at what speed though so wanted to play it safe. 100% agree on using multiple flaps with individual axis. I was putting it off for the future for larger single-copters because as you pointed out they complicate the design. Linking them with each other is not simple. Alternatively each could have it’s own servo, but that’s a lot of extra weight at the bottom."

You will see from the graph that the copter jumped into the air about 1.5m. In does that on every take-off. It takes-off to fast. Why? It’s kind of good for this craft, but how can I control it? What parameter should I use if I want to slow it down? With the right stick centered, the copter was making about 3 m circles – would not hover over one point. I had to continuously gently correct it. Eventually it became unstable, looked like it was about to crash so I turned into Land mode. It shot up instantly about 1m higher (why?), and then it went down almost like a rock. It was not the present 30 cm/sec. The speed of landing was totally unacceptable. I’m glad it went down from less than 3m so it is still in one piece. The log though shows that the altitude was much more, but that is not true.

If your function is one of these, it will use MOT_PWM_MIN and MOT_PWM_MAX. Otherwise, it will use the corresponding SERVOx_ limits.

You can see that here very clearly :  RC4 in red is saturating before everything goes south. The other servos saturate later. This very high in red value is not making the roll pitch yaw error (difference between target and actual value, in blue and orange) go away, so I think this is the cause and the saturation is not a side effect of something else (it could be a side effect, but I don’t know what else to look for after seeing that). Also, this is RCout, not the real position of the flaps, if you have a physical limitation on the copter it could have saturated earlier. Notably, another servo is close to saturation during takeoff, but then stabilizes. To solve this I can only give you basic single-copter guideline :  Big flaps High CoG (center of gravity) (this won’t work if you loose yaw auth first, here I don’t know) More weight (this will increase the flow and flaps authority) Center the CoG very carefuly  This crash I think likely happened because your CoG was not centered and put all the weight/torque on this poor flap 4, the 3 other flaps seem alright with gentle movements.

The flap issue came up recently when I changed a frame and noticed that they run into new frame components. Don’t know if it worked the same way in the older versions, but I would think that this should be an easy fix. Just changing PWM numbers for a boot-up? I believe that this may be a left over from quad-copters, to assure that the motors would not spin. For a single copter the number should be around 1500. If I could access this parameter from MP and change it there, it would be awesome."
9,"Flaps go to the max on power up, before arming 4.0.5",3,"The flaps in my single copter swing all the way to the max, or close to the max position on power up. This damages gears in the servos because flaps hit other parts of the copter. After I arm the AP, servos go to trim. What can I change in the setup to make servos go to trim or to a predetermined position on power up?","I am afraid that’s the most help you can expect on your “own, heavily customized” firmware. The next would be to backup, and test with current release. All I can say, is that I don’t see anything like that on planes or quadplanes."

11,SingleCopter Yaw Toilet bowl effect,0,"Hi guys, I’ve built a few similar single-copters and always end up with yaw offsets / slight or aggressive toilet bowl effect on stabilize and alt-hold modes. I have jumped into PID tuning and filtering but I have not achieved stable flight. The problem becomes worse with bigger EDF motors. Also, the longer the flight time the more the pendulum effect is compounded. I have included my latest flight log for your opinion. Thank you! Flight log: *",
12,Single Copter and Compass use,1,Building a single copter with 4 servos and thinking of using a Omnibus F4. Will I need to add a compass to this build as this FC only has Baro onboard. Thanks Joe,"According to my experience (with a coaxial copter, but that should not matter) you do can fly without a compass. You will have to tweak some bits in arm checks, but flights are indeed possible (and in my case, not very terrible). However, you may want to add it later (e.g. by adding a GPS+compass unit), since having a reliable source for yaw will prevent yaw drifting that may be small, but is inevitable when using only gyros."

I asked on the Audropilot site last night and someone confirmed that the Aurdopilot software will be OK with out compass.  Possibly a little yaw drift.  I can add a compass later if it flys under Audrropilot.  I have no experience with Betaflight so I decided to do things the hard way!

Benjamin Prescher used a modern flight controller and not compatible with ArduPilot, but I can confirm that the F4 works very well, you just have to adjust the PIDs until stable flight is achieved, and correctly map motors and orientation. I don’t like the design of the drone, the center of mass is too high. Tell us how, I already asked for a compatible ESC to explore with ArduPilot!"

Thanks Joe,Hi * I too am working on the same project and I’m using a pixracer R15 with ardupilot. It is a challenging project but I am very impressed with how far I’ve come with the project. Initially it was a nut case and very unstable and uncontrollable but as soon as I started tweaking the PID values it started getting better. I also had to reverse the pitch on my radio transmitter and tweak the AHRS_TRIM_X&Y values in mission planner to counter the roll and pitch drifts. My single copter now flies much better but not super smooth yet. Stabilized is the only flight mode that I’ve been using. I plan to try Pos_hold later on. At the moment I have no GPS on my ball drone.

Now the copter stays pretty still in the yaw axis.  I have not done any throttle tuning yet. The throttle does not sound good. Althold mode is not so smooth but Poshold and loiter with optical flow are kinda smooth. I have never had to tune throttle before in any copter I have built and so I am a bit reluctant to dive into it. Below are the new PID values for pitch, roll and yaw.         "

My Yaw has been good in Loiter and Satbilze, but i did a lot or rework to get rid of slop in the control vanes.  These small ceap servors are not the best either. Never payed with flow controll but that sound fun.  Ditto on throttle management, never messed with. These are my Yaw settings.

13,Is it possible to AutoTune a CoaxCopter?,1,"I am having a lot of fun and pain with my fifth build of a CoaxCopter. * The philosophy of the build is to aim at the lightest possible vehicle, assuming it is (a) ducted, (b) FPV-capable and (c) works with 5"" props. This means that the mass of motors, propellers and ESCs is not negligibly small, hence the whole vehicle is bound to have a high center of gravity - in fact, the higher the better, to have enough pitch/roll control authority of the flaps. In turn, this means that the vehicle is much more like an inverted pendulum. As a result, too small P term in PIDs results in not just a sluggish copter like it is with quads, but in dangerous oscillations. These can be self-accelerating if P is much too small - I had a couple of violent crashes - or fading in hover, but getting back as soon as I try to get some non-zero speed. When speaking of “too small”, I mean ATC_RAT_PIT_P = 0.2 is way too small. Seriously. My quads of same, smaller and larger sizes all have smaller (some much smaller) values. Given all that, is it ever possible to use the standard AutoTune procedures to obtain some decent tuning? I mean, it is possible to invoke: today I have finally managed to invoke AutoTune, and it did two twitches, after which I had to cope with some 1 m/s wind, failed to gain pitch authority to get some positive speed, ran into a protective net over a football field and melted one of my propellers. The logs showed that the second twitch is commented by “failed to level, please tune manually”, then it attempted to have a third one but was interrupted by me. However, I don’t know if it is just “multiply your PIDs by 1.5 then go back and try” or a sign that AutoTune shall not be used at all with a frame like this.",I would not expect it to work well. Coax should probably have a significant feed forward term that auto tune cannot find.

In particular, it destabilizes quickly when attempting to fly upwind. Just in case, it has plenty of power to do that - it just catches insanely huge oscillations before it does. My main concern is that AutoTune may have some assumptions (e.g. monotonicity of having oscillations with respect to P or D value) which CoaxCopter, or even this particular build, may not meet. I have not read the code yet, and I believe it is not easy to understand whether it actually converges even after reading the code."

If they are then you can just use the single heli frame type and use the H1 swashplate type. If not then you will have to describe your swashplate set up and we can got from there. Thinking about this more, if you have independently controlled swashplates then we just added the intermeshing configuration to dual heli and that could also control a coaxial head"

So you will want to look at master if you look at the code. * is our expert with the intermeshing mixer code. The intermeshing has two ways of controlling yaw: differential collective pitch and differential longitudinal cyclic. For your coaxial config, you would set the parameter H_YAW_SCALAR to zero. I’d be interested to get your feedback on this once you get it installed and flying. I will have to change the selection for DCP_MODE to add coaxial with intermeshing. Pretty exciting."

Gyro bias. level of gyro assist for normal flight vs deliberate aerobatics. Orbit-autopilot. Fairly standard. Elevator pitch bias. I want to mix on the pitch stick, from mainly elevator, to mainly cyclic. cyclic can have a slight mix from thrust throttle as well. Elevator macro trim. The Kaman uses elevator to oppose cyclic down-pitch, to avoid or reduce a nose-over. This can be used to allow rotor-driven forward speed. Rotor RPM top limit - pot. Thrust RPM/ throttle-pot. Wing feathering - switch. 12 Wing pitch trim- pot.  This controls relative rotor and wing angles of attack. This is addition to the built-in 3 degrees down-rotor.

I now have all the build environment and a lot of info, but you are allowed to ask for clarifications. I thought the box diagram wasn’t too hard to follow. The actual aircraft is a combi-copter , with winglets that swivel, and a pusher tail prop, and an intermeshing twin rotor setup. If you want some pictures, just ask, and I will post some. The main problem is I need some info on whether I can combine two input channels in a defined way. ie: 1)set an upper rpm limit or scale factor with a separate channel input, 2) set a mixer-slider operation on pitch input, so it goes from elevator output, mixed elevator and cyclic pitch( pitch only) to cyclic pitch only, -as opposed to cyclic roll- there is a terminology problem there. This is probably in the setup instructions somewhere, but it sounds to me like something that wasn’t anticipated in the initial scope. I want to keep using Arducopter to get use out of my f765 unit, but don’t want to learn the the full system at a programming level. An Arduino Zero is more my pace, but not so good for gyro stuff, or number of output PWM channels, plus the 9 or so analog connections. There is a nice helicopter app available, but probably not totally suitable. It has is own desktop graphical interface than runs on Windows. I need the f765 for:  s-bus connection to the receiver, stabilised 5V output.   a bit of overkill, but I have one on-hand.  If I try to pass-through up to 12 transmitter channels, and add up to 4 more outputs, the Zero may not handle it. I don’t know if I can run the uarts purely as digital outputs, not PWM. It is not a good idea to divide up channels that need gyro assist. that means, only the tail motor is left? Main motors , too, if I can set a scale factor on them. I don’t think the Arduino has a bus system for control inputs. It also only has 256K eprom, which is a little small. The F765 has 2 Mb eprom. the Zero is probably ok for speed, at 40Mhz,32 bit.- vs F765 around 500mhz… Now this stuff is a bit outside the realm of model aircraft hobbyists, I suppose, and getting back to the arduino side of things… Any arduino enthusiasts can chip in now!

Most of us have moved away from Arduino as a flight controller because better (and sometimes cheaper) options exist today. EDIT: After reading again, I see that you are indeed trying to use a Matek flight controller but you are somehow convinced that it will not provide the functionality you desire (but then you also go on to discuss using an Arduino Zero in its place, hence my confusion).

Can you provide a picture of the proposed vehicle and a simple list of requirements? You probably know exactly what the system needs to control but Your approach of cascading microcontrollers is not suited for ArduPilot as we use logical controllers embedded into the code in order to accomplish this goal. That makes the development much easier and efficient. I encourage you to read the different wiki that we provide so we can speak the same language and we can refer to common concepts. Good Luck"

I have only a hazy idea about how a pitch, roll, yaw, and altitude control system should work. Basic hover control is similar to a helicopter, only the 3-servo multiplex is done differently. Vertical control is like a simple “fixed” pitch helicopter, by throttle. vertical damping is done via a barometer module, Pitch is done by a system of 4 thrust reversing bucket servos. 2 do pitch-down, and 2 do pitch-up. this also interacts slightly with altitude control. Roll is done by 2 sets of double butterflies, which are very non-progressive, and need to be cycled fairly slowly due to mechanical constraints and inertia. It is likely they cannot be fully cycled in under 0.1 seconds. Changeover needs to re-assign the the servos, in that forward motion activates a closed set of twin butterflies, then configures them as thrust vector flaps. there are 2 sets which act like ailerons. As this is done , the roll control butterflies are fully closed. Hover yaw is done by butterflies as well, assisted by the rudder in forward flight. Pitch is mainly handled by the elevator in forward flight, with “bucket” intervention if elevator response is lacking. There is another flight stage: If throttle/rotor speed requirements drop below a nominated level, additional airflow may be directed to the rear thrust system via another pair of butterfly diverters, rotating through a fixed angle. throttle is then increased to take this into account. This may happen simply by level flight, or if dynamic lift is attained. One can imagine that the lift rotors need to be backed off to such an extent that forward thrust cannot be maintained. This could call for some redesign. I doesn’t sound all that simple. I will attach a drawing, and you can find all the flap devices on it. Much testing and tuning will be needed to get pitch and roll control to work properly, including possible redesign. I am trying to avoid using add-on EDF units , as they really eat batteries. If I can use a number of units that draw less that 10A on 3S, I may consider it. "

This seems to be only about 50% efficient, but it will do for now.   I will have a read of Multiwii, which may be more suitable for direct hacks.   The kind of (twin, opposed) vane tuning I imagine is to set limits of initial blowby, upper and lower vane angle limits, say 30 degrees and 60 degrees, balance the two roll thrusters against each other, and work from there, in possibly stepwise servo motion requests- say in 5 percent thrust increments. This may be small enough to not produce high rates of roll angular acceleration and severe roll pitch.   Smoother increments, and velocity ramp-up-ramp-down may be applicable, as for electric motors. They can tolerate stepwise inputs, but respond in a ramping fashion. I may have to move away from strict emulation of an analog feedback loop to get good results, but I can try that first. I will have look through your block diagram as inspiration. The Bucket deflectors are a whole other proposition, as I have to divide output into two parts- pitch-down, and pitch-up. They also are intended to work in a more oscillating manner to the roll flaps, as they are likely to be quite “vicious” in action. Tuning will involve calibrating dip swing and dip duration, then re-evaluation of angular velocity and angle after each dip. This also departs from a strict analog feedback loop. It also raises the possibility of creating an “autotune” feature.  Do you use this? Simulated “P-factor” adjustment, and more deliberate interval-based measurement and trimming. Anyhow, the first job is to build a motor stand and run in the engine. Then I need to build and test the contra-rotating drive. Then I will build a “Flying Bedstead” test rig. Then I will start programming and testing. All this will take quite a while. I may have other design ideas or refinements in the meantime."

Gyro stabilisation is now by 30mm edf units, 4 used. Mechanical buckets are retained just to assist vertical stability, to compensate for slower response from the IC constant pitch lift system. They can also be multiplexed with manual pitch control. manual roll control can be assisted with the pairs of facing butterflies. The remaining issues are:  mode changeover for the thrust system, from block-off to thrust vectoring. shutoff to the roll butterflies when thrust vectoring takes over. stage one lift diversion to thrust. stage 2 blanking off parts of the lift aperture if aerodynamic lift is achieved, to maintain thrust. changeover of stability control to flying surfaces from edfs.  These changes make it likely that arducopter or arduplane can be used for some initial flight testing, if the stability output can be diverted to the EDF units. The other issues can be dealt with in further development. Vertical stabilisation could be partly assisted by the edf units, with about 100 gf each maximum. Partitioning control between the edfs and the IC throttle could be tricky, as they are effectively two control loops trying to do the same job."

In the end, your servos acts on the flow of air, this doesn’t change with how the prop spins. The thing that will change is the angular momentum of your prop. When accelerating the prop, the copter will yaw the other way, and when rotating the copter, the gyroscopic precession will add a pitch or yaw offset by + or - 90° to your input. But Ardupilot does not considere those phenomenon, it would need a feed forward in the control loop and I never saw it. The PID alone is enough to compensate for it."

19,New Type CoaxCopter and need some help!,1,"Hi everyone, I am an Erasmus student at Klagenfurt University. My professor designed a copter and I am not sure how I can build pixhawk on it. The article link about the helicopter is below. Now I should explain the design of the UAV. The UAV consists of a double-blade coaxial shaft rotor and four swash masses that allow changing the orientation and maneuvering the UAV. Also, the difference between a coax helicopter and a swash mass helicopter is that one of the blades is upside down. How can I customize pixhawk ( I am using QGroundController) to hover this helicopter and stabilize it ? The architecture of a swash mass helicopter is a little bit different from a coax copter and I do not if I can customize it for hovering. ( My first task is to fly it and maintain it in the air. Then I will work on pitch, roll, and yaw axes).  First, Should I select the airframe as a Coax copter for this design? How can I control altitude by thrust? I am asking that because one of the blades is up-side-down and I want to know if it occurs a problem to control it. How can I customize pixhawk ( I am using QGroundController) to hover this helicopter and stabilize it? I have a transmitter to control the UAV.

I don’t understand what’s up with the upside down blade. This could be your answer : the Coax algo can control altitude and yaw by modulating the speed of the two counter rotating props. Outputs on the pixhawk in Coax will be PWM, and you will use that to control the servos (totally normal for the Coax frame_class). This will control pitch and roll, the two props will control thrust and yaw.  If I were you, I would try making it work with Coax to see if you really need to modify it, and this way you’ll be familiar with how Coax (and pixhawk) works before modifying it. Start small. Also after rereading your post there I’m worried by this part : “My first task is to fly it and maintain it in the air. Then I will work on pitch, roll, and yaw axes”. The system is unstable, you need pitch, roll (and yaw) working to fly. The Center of Mass below the thrust does not make a copter stable, this is called *. If you want to test thrust control first, you’ll need a system that blocks pitch and yaw. But, to me this is useless because your first flights should be in manual control (you control the thrust directly with your radio). "" fly it and maintain it in the air"" should be your last task. I would advise : Yaw ->  Pitch and Roll -> Altitude as a roadmap."

I don’t know, but (after thinking more about it) the dynamic of your system is the same as a the single/coax frame. It should work with the default frame class/type and you’ll first have to THOROUGHLY follow the doc * (this is just the setup for coax then there is the global documentation). Why is it the same as a Coax with flaps ? you may ask. Flaps induce a torque that is linked to the angle of the servo, the single/coax algo works with that. Your swash mass do the same, they create a torque (because the center of inertia is not aligned with the thrust) that is linked to the angle of the servo. I believe the Single/Coax frame class should work without any modification.  Lastly, my professor provides me a system that can block the orientation of drones. But, my professor recommend me to do land it and stabilize it in the air? Do you highly recommend me to control yaw first?  If you can block the orientation, then yes, test the thrust first and get used to manual control (manual is the best flight mode to do reliable tests on pitch roll yaw). I’d do Thrust -> Yaw -> Pitch and Roll -> Free flight (having altitude control is useless before you can free flight, all first test should be done in manual mode. Plus, there are also problems with altitude estimation in a confined environment)"

Here was my explanation, but I’d like other to verify it (though it’s not my problem but yours, I find the idea interesting). This is what an angled servo will do on a flap system: The angle of the servo moves the thrust, the thrust T is not aligned with the center of inertia G (that cannot move), thus the copter rotates (clockwise in my figure). This is what happens with the same servo on your swash mass system: It’s the same except G moves instead of T. The angle of the servo moves the center of inertia G, the thrust T (that cannot move) is not aligned with G, thus the copter rotates (clockwise in my figure). I know that G will not be exactly on the moving mass and that you have a linear rail, those simplification are for illustration purpose.

You will need to be more specific as to what you mean regarding “explains the dynamic structure”.   Are you looking for physical information like size of vehicle and aerodynamic surfaces in order to determine how much moment/acceleration can be produced.  I don’ know how many users would actually have this data as it is probably a hobby for them where it is work/research related for you.  I think the arducopter firmware provides the necessary control capability.  It will probably be more experimentation on your part to determine the necessary PID control gains for your application. I’m not discouraging you from asking more questions.  I just think you need to be more specific as to what you are looking for.  I hope you find the answers you are looking for."
19,New Type CoaxCopter and need some help!,17,"Hi everyone, I am an Erasmus student at Klagenfurt University. My professor designed a copter and I am not sure how I can build pixhawk on it. The article link about the helicopter is below. Now I should explain the design of the UAV. The UAV consists of a double-blade coaxial shaft rotor and four swash masses that allow changing the orientation and maneuvering the UAV.

We, as hobbyist, are confident in our troubleshooting skills and prior knowledge, where a researcher or an engineer will be confident in its calculations and data. Obviously it’s not a clear cut, you can very well do a more hands-on approach to a project as an engineer/researcher. But schools (and investors) don’t really like when you go forward through failures and corrections, even though it can be faster to just wing it (that’s what I did, a single copter was one of my school project that lasted for 3 years before being canceled by my group, and I now did it in 4 months with the wing it strategy while being “unemployed” because of covid). Anyway, I don’t have any documentations (mine were mainly Youtube videos of similar builds to have a sense of scale and if it’s possible) but calculating the dynamic yourself is not very hard, you only have 1 force and the center of mass (and gravity, but that’s nothing, just an acceleration on z)."

A video helps to know what I should be looking for in logs, maybe I only need the video and seeing a singlecopter fly is always cool). It’s possible that one of your servo gets saturated (the flap can’t move any further), this looks like a loss of yaw control. You cannot see that on the string because the yaw alone does not saturate the servo, nor pitch, nor roll, but two of those command at the same time can saturate the servo.

But there is no real hard clue as to what makes the servo saturate. Here’s the graph : The yaw (pink) is slightly misaligned and this makes RCout1 (green) increase to correct it (1-2s before the saturation). It can be noted that green was never this high for a long time in the rest of the flight. Always before saturation, around the big increase of green, pitch and roll (yellow and orange) began to drift down. So the controller increased green to also correct for that. And this made green (servo1) saturate. I don’t know what caused the drift on yaw, pitch or roll at this precise moment, but seeing the rest of the flight those misalignment don’t seem unusual. Except for yaw that is usually very quickly corrected, this was not the case here and made green go unusually up for long time, with bad luck a correction on roll/pitch was also needed at that time and saturated the servo. You can also notice that the loss of yaw control is the most noticeable because it begins 0.5s before the other lose control. But the start of the problem is servo saturation."

You can also try lowering the other PIDs if the problem continues. (On mine I almost did not use I in the PID of the yaw, it didn’t seem to be much of a problem.) Another solution is to extend the fins to create higher torque with the same servo angle. PS : you can easily lower the yaw PID with a string test. I’d find a softer one that works fine this way. PSS : you can also add more weight, this will increase the airflow and create more lift/torque on your fins. Mine hovered at 60-80% thrust (depending on battery level and additional load)"

You can see that when servo3 saturates, yaw control is lost (pitch and roll follow very quickly after that).

This is another of mine, here there was no crash and I just sweat balls after seeing the copter rotate on its own right after a roll input, then landed. You can see that it hugely impacts the yaw. But still, on mine the servo is always close to the limit, where on yours the servo stays quite far during the flight. This difference can come down from the difference in build or PID, idk, or it can be a different problem. Also centering the center of mass is really important, if you don’t one servo will always be much closer to saturation (this was one of the problem with my logs, servo3 had to compensate for the weight). If you want those logs: * (482 KB) * (448 KB) This was one of the first successfull flights with longer fins, I’m further from saturation and no problem. Plus, what I want you to see is that my yaw PID was (really) bad/slow compared to yours (also had no filter on the gyro), so you don’t need the fastest PID of the west for a single-copter. and this was the performance of the yaw PID near the end of the project, still very bad/slow but it worked really great, never had any problem."

The PWM at which throttle lever hits a stop is 1620 so the MOT_PWM_MAX = 1618. My concern is: in AltHold mode the copter should start taking off after I advance the stick about 20% past mid range of throttle stick on my radio. Controlling of ascend and descending is by moving the stick past or below that mid point on the radio. It is my understanding that the autopilot automatically recalculates the PWM values from my radio into proper PWM output to the throttle servo (Mot_PWM). I know it’s a silly question, because that is why we calibrate both the radio and set those Mot_PWM min and max values, but having the hoover point so close to max throttle, and Mot_PWM_Max so low scares me. My electric monocopters fly nicely in auto modes but this underpowered gasoline beast is a different animal altogether. Not mentioning a very long spool up time."
22,Hello! Is anyone there? Any Developers? SERVO5 vs MOT_PWM,7,"Servo5_Max and Mot_PWM_Max - how they differ since both control the same and only motor in a single copter, assigned to Servo5 (option 37)?

You’ll end up using it all the time, and maybe graduate to Loiter one day. Stabilize Mode is of course the most manual mode (except Acro) and your go-to emergency mode. There’s been so many stories on here from people asking about “why did my drone crash when I switched to Stabilize?” and of course they had the throttle at minimum, they directed it to fall like a brick. We’ve taken to using a spring-centered throttle and PILOT_THR_BHV,7 Some are dead against that, but generally these days it makes sense, and you’ll find Stabilize and AltHold will end up both at same centered throttle position after a while."

I’ve never flown quad-copters, I designed and built my single copters and that’s the only drones I’ve ever flown. In Stabilize I manage to take off and quickly land before I lose orientation. AltHold and Loiter in the Super-Simple mode, with Land and RTL at my disposal make it possible for me to fly and make them return back safely. Wired, isn’t it? I just enjoy developing more than flying…   Not much time left for buying “the real thing” and learning to fly it. My 5"" electric single copters are too heavy to fly longer than for about a minute or two. The next one will be a 12"" which should finally stay in the air for 15 min or so. That should finally let me learn to fly them  But my real goal is to develop a gas powered single-copter that will stay in the air for an hour or longer. The electric copters are just stepping stones for me because they are sooooo simple. I’m a mechanical engineer - gas engines, transmissions, airplane design… not much programming and electric toys… Now you understand why auto modes are critical for me. I’m just not good enough to fly drones manually. After a few crashes I managed to take off and immediately land my gasser in Stabilize. When I did it in Loiter, it took off but after 3 sec of hoover it went hey wire. Went into resonance, nose dived and committed a suicide. I rebuilt it and half a year later put it back on test rig. Sure enough the PIDs were way too small. I also noticed that there are position PIDs that were way too tight for that size/inertia of a copter. Did not know position PIDs existed. I’m getting ready to test fly it again, but I’m afraid it may not have enough time to “learn”.  How long it takes to complete the learning? That PILOT_THR_BHV,7 intrigued me. Will have to find out what that is. I feel like a blind person walking in a forest created by programmers who think that everything they created is soooo obvious to everyone… Not that I’m oblivious to programming. I know Fortran, Basic, but… I’m still lost in arducopter."

It’s extremely hard to put all this together from thousands of individual pieces not always related to each other. Especially if you don’t have someone experienced around to help you out. In my case each crash let me learn a lot because it made me know what questions to ask. I’ve been advocating for some time for an Ardupilot/Arducopter on-line Academy. Wouldn’t necessarily have to be free. Should teach you step by step everything about all the features of Ardu and how to use them properly. From novice to advanced. Forum is a great tool but how many hundreds of questions you need to ask before you are comfortable with the software? Not the most efficient way to learn.

That was my first ever copter, I higly suggest to anyone to not build a Single-Copter without any experience before (like me) because it is the worst frame type. It’s fun, yes, but VERY unforgiving. * * In this thread I’ll give you advices on building your own based on the choices I’ve done for my build.   Weight : it will be heavy, mine is 900g. I initialy calculated for 1kg of thrust for less than 700g of wheight, luckily I have more thrust than expected (1.3kg I think). My structure is not heavy (150-200g), but the electronics add up quickcly for this poor single motor.   Prop : I would not advise anything less than 10"" 4.5 (that’s what I have with a 4S and a 900kV brushless). You won’t be able to lift anything smaller since the electronic does not scale with the prop size.   Fins : MAKE THEM BIG it’s the heart of your copter. Mine are 12cm long (I made them too small 2 times in a row : 4cm and 8 cm) and * (it seems nice to me … yeah I hate fluid dynamics)   Structure : It is bound to break if you crash the copter. It’s impossible to do something strong (and light) with those 12cm fins while dodging the big-ass propeller just above/below. With more thrust you may be able to build something strong. BTW everything I’ve done is 3D printed using colorfab LW-PLA (only 200g with 3D printing is quite impressive, and foam is also a good alternative).   Legs : don’t make them springy if your thrust control is below the center of gravity. If  your thrust control is below the center of gravity, the copter is unstable when the legs touch the ground. So you have to make them wide and rigid.   Center of gravity : ALWAYS CENTER THIS BAD BOY !!! and make it as far as possible from thrust rotation point (i.e. from your fins). This will help with stability a lot (On mine I can slide the battery around to help with the balancing) (also, levelling the copter is hard, I built a support to align the motor rotation axis with the gravity)   Tuning : First tune the yaw on a string. With that you’ll see if your fins are long enough, they should not be far from straight while stable (see my close up videos to see the stable angle on mine). Tuning roll/pitch with a string is very hard because it changes the dynamic a lot when under tension. If your TVC (thrust vector control i.e. fins) is below the COG (center of gravity), the string should be attached below the COG. Otherwise the string should be above the COG (not too far away) [Edit : wrong see my comment]. If you do this, the dynamic while the string is under tension will not destabilise the copter PID. Personaly I was not able to finish tuning with a string, it’s really hard if your TCV is below the COG.   My tuning (D is quite important to counter the gyroscopic precession) : (I’m still looking for the perfect tune, and I’m afraid of autotune) *   Servos vibration : because of the masse attached to the servos (a 18g fin) the servos tend to oscilate if there is no friction to dampen it. You simply need to add friction where you can to stop it.   And I think that’s all folks, feel free to ask questions and propose some improvement ! Currently I’m working on filtering the vibration with the Notch Filter before tuning the roll/pitch PID more precisely.","Erratum in “7. tuning”  If your TVC (thrust vector control i.e. fins) is below the COG (center of gravity), the string should be attached below the COG. Otherwise the string should be above the COG (not too far away).  After thinking more about it, where ever your TVC or COG is, attaching the string below the COG seems to be better. IDK if someone with a TVC above its COG will ever try but for my configuration (TVC below the COG) that was the case. I mainly say this because it was stable with my copter, so take this with a grain of salt, but here is why : With the string (under tension, theoricaly you don’t want that tension but in reality it will always happen at least during take off) below the COG, the copter wants to flip and the PID (roll/pitch) will keep it balanced. The important thing is that you do not need a lot of thrust for the PID to work on the balancing with this configuration. You can already troubleshoot here, and that’s not possible with the string above the COG (the copter is stable and does not flip nor need the PID). Here you can build up thrust and the PID will be working all along the way, to hopefully go straight up. With the string above the COG you can’t test the balancing up until the string becomes loose and it’s much more difficult. You can’t do any low thrust test. I also suspect that the control loop + string make the Copter higly unstable when the string is above the COG, mine was oscilating like crazy and going everywhere."

That was my first ever copter, I higly suggest to anyone to not build a Single-Copter without any experience before (like me) because it is the worst frame type. It’s fun, yes, but VERY unforgiving. * * In this thread I’ll give you advices on building your own based on the choices I’ve done for my build.   Weight : it will be heavy, mine is 900g. I initialy calculated for 1kg of thrust for less than 700g of wheight, luckily I have more thrust than expected (1.3kg I think). My structure is not heavy (150-200g), but the electronics add up quickcly for this poor single motor.   Prop : I would not advise anything less than 10"" 4.5 (that’s what I have with a 4S and a 900kV brushless). You won’t be able to lift anything smaller since the electronic does not scale with the prop size.   Fins : MAKE THEM BIG it’s the heart of your copter. Mine are 12cm long (I made them too small 2 times in a row : 4cm and 8 cm) and * (it seems nice to me … yeah I hate fluid dynamics)   Structure : It is bound to break if you crash the copter. It’s impossible to do something strong (and light) with those 12cm fins while dodging the big-ass propeller just above/below. With more thrust you may be able to build something strong. BTW everything I’ve done is 3D printed using colorfab LW-PLA (only 200g with 3D printing is quite impressive, and foam is also a good alternative).   Legs : don’t make them springy if your thrust control is below the center of gravity. If  your thrust control is below the center of gravity, the copter is unstable when the legs touch the ground. So you have to make them wide and rigid.   Center of gravity : ALWAYS CENTER THIS BAD BOY !!! and make it as far as possible from thrust rotation point (i.e. from your fins). This will help with stability a lot (On mine I can slide the battery around to help with the balancing) (also, levelling the copter is hard, I built a support to align the motor rotation axis with the gravity)   Tuning : First tune the yaw on a string. With that you’ll see if your fins are long enough, they should not be far from straight while stable (see my close up videos to see the stable angle on mine). Tuning roll/pitch with a string is very hard because it changes the dynamic a lot when under tension. If your TVC (thrust vector control i.e. fins) is below the COG (center of gravity), the string should be attached below the COG. Otherwise the string should be above the COG (not too far away) [Edit : wrong see my comment]. If you do this, the dynamic while the string is under tension will not destabilise the copter PID. Personaly I was not able to finish tuning with a string, it’s really hard if your TCV is below the COG.   My tuning (D is quite important to counter the gyroscopic precession) : (I’m still looking for the perfect tune, and I’m afraid of autotune) *   Servos vibration : because of the masse attached to the servos (a 18g fin) the servos tend to oscilate if there is no friction to dampen it. You simply need to add friction where you can to stop it.   And I think that’s all folks, feel free to ask questions and propose some improvement !

My background in flying very stable flybar-head glow Helis, (on which pitch and roll need no electronic stabilisation at all) led me to wrongly believe you were having trouble tuning your thrust vector rocket due to weight distribution.

I had two huge resonance : prop at 150Hz and servos at 17Hz. The PID of the servos was unstable because of the mass of the flaps. NGL I’m very impress by the quality of the fix 17Hz notch filter, I never though it could be that stable. (the settings are : center freq 17Hz, bandwidth 12Hz, attenuation 23dB) Before : After : And those two graphs are the servos output (from two flights, with similar XY scale), with the input filtering above, and without filtering below : * it looks like you are behind those filters, so : THANK YOU, they work very well !"

That was my first ever copter, I higly suggest to anyone to not build a Single-Copter without any experience before (like me) because it is the worst frame type. It’s fun, yes, but VERY unforgiving. * * In this thread I’ll give you advices on building your own based on the choices I’ve done for my build.   Weight : it will be heavy, mine is 900g. I initialy calculated for 1kg of thrust for less than 700g of wheight, luckily I have more thrust than expected (1.3kg I think). My structure is not heavy (150-200g), but the electronics add up quickcly for this poor single motor.   Prop : I would not advise anything less than 10"" 4.5 (that’s what I have with a 4S and a 900kV brushless). You won’t be able to lift anything smaller since the electronic does not scale with the prop size.   Fins : MAKE THEM BIG it’s the heart of your copter. Mine are 12cm long (I made them too small 2 times in a row : 4cm and 8 cm) and * (it seems nice to me … yeah I hate fluid dynamics)   Structure : It is bound to break if you crash the copter. It’s impossible to do something strong (and light) with those 12cm fins while dodging the big-ass propeller just above/below. With more thrust you may be able to build something strong. BTW everything I’ve done is 3D printed using colorfab LW-PLA (only 200g with 3D printing is quite impressive, and foam is also a good alternative).   Legs : don’t make them springy if your thrust control is below the center of gravity. If  your thrust control is below the center of gravity, the copter is unstable when the legs touch the ground. So you have to make them wide and rigid.   Center of gravity : ALWAYS CENTER THIS BAD BOY !!! and make it as far as possible from thrust rotation point (i.e. from your fins). This will help with stability a lot (On mine I can slide the battery around to help with the balancing) (also, levelling the copter is hard, I built a support to align the motor rotation axis with the gravity)   Tuning : First tune the yaw on a string. With that you’ll see if your fins are long enough, they should not be far from straight while stable (see my close up videos to see the stable angle on mine). Tuning roll/pitch with a string is very hard because it changes the dynamic a lot when under tension. If your TVC (thrust vector control i.e. fins) is below the COG (center of gravity), the string should be attached below the COG. Otherwise the string should be above the COG (not too far away) [Edit : wrong see my comment]. If you do this, the dynamic while the string is under tension will not destabilise the copter PID. Personaly I was not able to finish tuning with a string, it’s really hard if your TCV is below the COG.   My tuning (D is quite important to counter the gyroscopic precession) : (I’m still looking for the perfect tune, and I’m afraid of autotune) *   Servos vibration : because of the masse attached to the servos (a 18g fin) the servos tend to oscilate if there is no friction to dampen it. You simply need to add friction where you can to stop it.   And I think that’s all folks, feel free to ask questions and propose some improvement ! Currently I’m working on filtering the vibration with the Notch Filter before tuning the roll/pitch PID more precisely.","Thanks a bunch! This helps a lot to get me started. I did a number of single copters around shrouded 5 inch props. The total weight was about 700g. Way too heavy to make them fly longer than 2 minutes. As you correctly stated - all the electronics make for the most of the weight and do not allow to reduce that weight and power consumption. The only way to increase efficiency and extend flight time is to go with larger size prop. My goal is to achieve 15-20 minutes of flight time and the 10 inch prop seems just right for that. 12 inch would be more efficient but it becomes bulky, and it would be hard to 3D print parts of that size. I see that I can transfer all the electronics from my 5"" copter and still have enough lift left for Lidar and a flow sensor. I also use 10g servos but of good quality, digital, high resolution, with metal gears. My only concern is the motor you used. Seems to me a bit small for the prop. May want to overheat. I think I will start with a 950-1200Kv 3635 size motor just to be safe. Thanks again for the info and congratulations on your design. I learned from you about those notch filters!"

24,Kinda disappointed,1,"First off lemme start with saying that this is nothing personal, I’m sure you guys are a lovely, happy, helpful community. Just, it’s not what I was trying to find you know? lol When I resorted to asking an online chat customer service rep for help finding what I needed to get my coax heli flying, when he seemed so sure that THIS PLACE was what I needed he had me convinced too! I was so excited to follow the URL he provided as I eagerly waited for the page to load so I could begin taking in info and hopefully getting some items in an online shopping cart that would finally get me airborne. Then came the crushing realization that this was NOT what I was talking about when I spoke of my coax heli…  Can anyone help me get where I’m actually trying to get? Cuz MY coax heli doesn’t have any FLAPS, nor does it utilize any SERVOS. It’s 2 mainblades with a swaybar controlling the swashplate, and a tailboom with a little motor+prop to tilt the heli forward to, you know, make it go forward… I have the complete airframe, motors, batteries, and a flysky ia6b/FS-i6X reciever/radio combo. I need a flight controller, brushed ESC’s for the motors, and I’ve read online maybe something called a gyro to hold tail lock? I’ve been totally stumped at finding any of it anywhere unfortunately…","In Ardupilot’s argo, SingleCopter and CoaxCopter are vehicles that are quite dissimilar to helicopters. These have one or two propellers aligned vertically, and airflow diverters (known as “flaps”) to shape the flow. A “traditional helicopter” is a different class, and since it has a “dual rotor” or “tandem rotor” helicopter frame type and corresponding sections, I think this is what you are looking for. * is the entry point for the parameters regarding multiple supported types of helicopters. (Unfortunately, I am not proficient in helicopters, so I cannot really help you further on)"
25,Servo5_Max vs. Mot_PWM_Max,0,"Servo5_Max  and  Mot_PWM_Max - how they differ since both control the same motor assigned to Servo5 (option 37)? Is anyone familiar with these two parameters, please?

26,Servo5 vs Mot_PWM what is the difference?,1,"Could someone explain to me the difference between Servo5 settings and Mot_PWM settings in a single copter? I thought that Servo5 output controls the motor. However in Stabilize, when I change Servo5_Max and Min I do not see that it has any effect on the max and min PWM that goes to the motor. But Mot_PWM_MAX and MIN does limit the PWM range that goes to the motor. In my case it is a PWM range that goes to the servo that controls the throttle of a gas motor. The Servo5 is option 37 (=Motor 5). Could someone please clarify for me the difference between Servo5 and Mot_? I don’t want to cause a conflict between these two.","Anyone familiar with these two parameters, please? Servo5_Max and Mot_PWM_Max  -  how they differ if both control the same motor?"

28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,20,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,It looks like you have insufficient thrust for stable flight. Commanded motor output is at max most of the time and you have Thrust Loss errors.
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,21,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,So its not problem of PID tuning ?
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,22,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,That is to be determined. First you have to improve the thrust/weight. More thrust or less weight.
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,23,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,"Dear Dave Do you know what can be potential reason for the thrust loss?? first thing is that when i did the test i pushed the throttle stick to max, which was maintained for sometime but after some seconds it started to fall while the stick was still at max. so could this be related to the yaw correction due to differential thrust because the throttle stick was at max.?? * Regards Abdul"
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,24,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,"I think the thrust/weight ratio is simply too low. The craft is too heavy for available thrust. Larger prop, higher voltage battery, less overall weight would be the optons."
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,25,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,"Yep, would say the same thing as *. Any further tuning will be useless (and dangerous for the copter) without more thrust (or less weight). No, the single copter algo do not use differential rotation speed of the two props to rotate, you should customize the heli side of ardupilot to do that (can’t find the source for this claim, but I’m pretty sure a dev once said it in the forum). BUT, when rotating, your flaps get in the flow of the props and that is what momentarily reduces your thrust."
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,26,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,Dear Lian Its not single copter but a coaxial copter as it caters the differential thrust. *
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,27,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,"Yeah I know that it’s a Coax. I checked your log and there is indeed differential thrust on the Coax-Copter side of Ardupilot. I thought it was not the case, my bad."
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,28,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,And it’s underpowered. Both commanded motor outputs shown here. Increase the thrust/weight ratio and then plot this for yourself. When the average outputs are ~1500us at hover it’s good.
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,29,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,Dear Dave I have attached a picture here you can see a green line which is of RC-IN channel 3. At about 51 seconds I didn’t change the stick input but the plot shows a dipped in the curve. so isn’t it possible that the connection between transmitter and receiver was lost at that time??? and that’s why RC OUT 5 thrust goes down ERR-THRUST? * * 
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,30,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,"If you are absolutely sure about the position of the stick, there could be an issue here. I don’t think it comes from a transmission problem though, this usually results in a sharp drop to below 1000us or no change. Maybe your stick has a problem idk. Then, this would not have resulted in a ERR-THRUST_LOSS on a functioning copter. This error occurs because you don’t have enough thrust. I can’t say that lowering RC3 doesn’t make the error appear in your case, but the problem is that you don’t have enough thrust."
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,31,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,"and the error occurs 2.5s before the dip of CH3.

28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,32,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,"The dip in the curve is because you lowered the throttle. And as * points out the thrust error was before this. YOU HAVE A LACK OF THRUST FOR THE WEIGHT OF THIS CRAFT. I have nothing else to add, good luck with your coaxial copter."
28,Ducted Fan UAV Ardupilot,33,I am doing a project now in the initial stage the project is about the Coaxial Ducted Fan UAV want some guidance related to how to use mission planner and pixhawk and it work on that thing.,I haven’t lowered the throttle in the entire flight then how this dip occurs? *

Unfortunately you do not have battery logging so no way to tell if it’s from the Flight battery. How are you powering the Flight Controller? You still have a lack of thrust. That needs to be addressed for this craft to fly properly."

They are nonetheless not practical at all. Because a single copter only has one propeller, the prop is very wide and a wide prop means a higher efficiency. Mine (that was far from perfect) had a single 10inch prop for 900g and flew for 10 min (4S 2500mAh battery). With a quad you cannot use 10in prop with only 900g and such a small form factor (the height clearance is pretty bad though). A 7in quad is better though if you are looking for not huge and long range. But if you are limited by weight, by for example some new laws, and want high efficiency, a single or an helicopter could be the solution."

Maximum stability is maintained at high power with more air rushing through the controllable vanes.   Add wider legs to the landing gear.  I rarely had it land and stay upright until I made a wider, more stable landing gear.   Make sure the prop directions are exactly as described in the Arducopter instructions, and make sure that the vanes are correcting in the proper directions.   Try hanging the machine from the ceiling on a string.  With enough power on you will be able to tell if it is stabilizing correctly, and the string will keep it from falling while you test.  "

33,Single/Coaxial Copter,1,I have problem with the flight controller basically i have APM 2.8 and when i plugged it into mission planner i didnt get the Parameters list of Frame class and Frame type. Can i use APM to fly by coaxial ducted fan UAV drone? any idea,"This for all people, trying to build coax/single copter on APM 2.8 or earlier versions. The first fact is APM 2.8 does not support versions after Copter 3.2.1. Second fact is all earlier versions till Copter 3.2.1, will not offer you Coax/Single Copter Frame selection by anymeans. There is no option called FRAME_CLASS there so there is no way you use mission planner to set your vehicle as coax/single copter. So what you need to do is, download Arduino-Ardupilot IDE (this software is different from Arduino IDE), and get a full Zip file of Arducopter 3.2.1 on github (incase you can’t find it ping me here). Now open that Zip file in your IDE and like 20+ tabs will open up, look for APM_Config.h in those tabs (probably the second tab) and set your frame_config as coax_frame in that code, and upload it to your APM 2.8 and open mission planner as usual and in lower tab where all yaw angle and altitude etc is shown, click on messages tab and u will see ur frame config set to COAX_FRAME.

Did not used the cheaper blue because they kept breaking (the blacks break too, only the first gear is not plastic). The only complain I have about the servos is that there was some play that led to the servo self-oscillating because of the mass/inertia of the fins, but adding friction to dampen the oscillation fixed it (I explained that somewhere before). What will determine your response time and stability is the amount and precision of torque you can apply. Longer fins and good mechanical structure was the limiting factor for me. BTW, *, you ca see that my fins already move really fast everywhere. But this does not result in a rotation of the main frame. That’s also why I think better servos will not help the response time."

Kind Regards","It was just quickly said in my main post :  Servos vibration : because of the masse attached to the servos (a 18g fin) the servos tend to oscilate if there is no friction to dampen it. You simply need to add friction where you can to stop it.  It’s simply that the PID of the servo can be bad if your fin is heavy AND if there is some play. It gains speed one way, then can’t slow down to stop on the target, overshoots and repeats (this happens inside the servo, and that’s what is moving the flaps in the video I sent, nothing to do with ardupilot because it also happened unarmed). Play plays a big role in this, because the servo shaft can be static with the flaps still moving fast exactly around equilibrium, this is throwing off the PID of the servo. But the torque of the servo is largely enough. If the servos were powered, and too much force was applied the inner gears broke, I broke a bunch of gears, but never while flying. (having spear servos from which you salvage the shitty plastic gear is helpful) Sorry, precision of the torque doesn’t mean much. I mean the position of the fins, it’s not a problem of servo resolution, those are surprisingly precise. But the link between servos and flaps can f*ck it up, for example, the servo could move a very little bit to correct, but then because of some play your flap doesn’t move."

(you have some close-up pictures and stl on thingiverse) There is a + shaped piece that goes inside the 4 flaps and (pivot) link the 4 flaps together. This way no torque is applied perpendicular to the servo axle. 4Flaps-+piece-4servos are all pressure held together, pressure is provided by the fixation system of the servos on the main frame (ie a shitty zip-tie). The downside of not gluing the flaps to the servo’s shaft is that you’ll have more play. But you can always glue my system. Anyway, thanks for the picture. The Flaps will collide at the top, you’ve cut the downside but not the top above the rotation point. Also, be careful with the flaps touching the blue frame. Also I like to have the flaps as low as possible, first this will increase torque. Furthermore if you have some flap chunks above the rotation point/axis, this will reduce the flow on the wrong side of the copter and create small torque that will rotate the craft the wrong way. The part below the rotation point/axis will decrease the flow on the right (good) side of the craft. That’s hard to explain … Imagine the bottom of you flap at full right, the main torque produced by the thrust vectoring is clockwise. But, the flap chunk above the rotation axis (of the flap) will reduce the flow on the left side of the copter, creating a small counter clockwise torque. The part below will create small clockwise torque (less flow on the right). That’s why I like having my flaps low if possible."

I intended on just mounting the vanes onto the servo horn via the screw that it comes with. Then just press fit the inner spline of the horn onto the outer spline of the servo  I think I get you. The longer the length above the rotation point, the more air hits that extended part and in turn (pun intended) causes slight rotation in the opposite rotation"

Kind Regards","I just wanted to point out that there are lots of different kinds of digital servos. I think it’s safe to say all hobby servos can receive a 50Hz control pulse. Some digital servos can receive much faster updates. Often the tail rotor of a helicopter will use a digital servo combined with a gyro which drives the servo much faster than 50Hz. These types of servos have much faster update speeds compared with other hobby servos. Many of these fast servos can’t be powered with 6V like other servos. The fast servos I use with my helicopter come with a 5V regulator to make sure the voltage isn’t too high. These fast servos need a corresponding fast drive signal. I think most flight controllers use the standard 50Hz signal to control servos. It’s possible this sort of thing can be configured in the flight controller. I know some ESCs can use fast protocols and many flight controllers can use these faster protocols so maybe flight controllers can also drive high speed servos faster than the standard 50Hz signal. Analog servos generally have torque proportional to how far the current position is from the target position. If an analog servo only needs to move a small amount, it won’t use as much torque as if it has to move a large amount. Digital servos generally produce full torque for all movements. This also means digital servos generally use more power than analog servos. Some digital servos have all sorts of extra features. Some can be assigned ID numbers and addressed with a SBus data line. These SBus servos can share a common data line. I’m new to ArduPilot but I’ve used a lot of servos. Here’s a *. BTW, very cool project. I’ve enjoyed reading everyone’s replies."

I would like to ask a question that has been troubling me about digital servos, sorry if its basic but i dont seem to grasp it. I tried asking on the arduino forum but was confused by the response. I had interpreted the difference between a digital servo and analog servo as : Both receive the same command signal from a receiver or arduino to change position. But a digital servo can output pulses that can control its servo motor at a higher frequency and change positions faster The reply i got was admittedly confusing on my end.

Kind Regards","I really like the reply by StefanL38. I’ve interacted that user on other forums and he has always provided great information. The “difference” diagram you posted is what is happening inside the servo. The internal electronics of a digital servo drives the motor with a higher frequency PWM signal. The internal frequency of an analog signal is the same as the 50Hz control frequency. The diagram shows the “kind 2” difference described by Stefan. As Stephan said, if you don’t need real high performance, the standard 50Hz signal is fine. If you need higher performance, you’ll need to look at the specific servo’s datasheet to learn what sort of frequency it can handle. I don’t think there’s a standard “digital servo frequency”. You’ll need to find out from the servo manufacture how to take advantage of the specific digital servo’s unique features. Edit: I should add than many digital servos don’t have unique features. They just use a microcontroller internally so small servo changes still maintain full torque. I think most digital servos don’t have extra features beyond the higher frequency internal motor drivers. Most digital servos should be driven the same as analog servos. They’ll just perform better (and use more power)."

I can’t see your prototype, but maybe your fins are too small and can’t produce enough torque to rotate the copter.

There could be a problem with the default value. I encountered some serious altitude oscilations. Those were long and wide (5-10 sec and 1m), you can find videos of * and * Before the fix :  * After the fix :  * BEFORE doing this I followed the tuning instruction here (AltHold section) * and here * . Those two aren’t exactly the same for some reasons. And I do not have a lot thrust (hover at 68%) but the problems is not there because I fixed it. Changing PSC_POSZ_P from 1.0 to 2.0 in Ardupilot fixed it for some reasons. NGL, this setting is wierd because it does not apear in the control loop of the documentation, Ardupilot advises to half it if there are oscilations but it was already at the minimum value (??? wrong default value I guess). Plus the oscilations seems to come from a weak P value that undercorrects, not an overshoot. So I multiplied it by 2 instead of 0.5 and it worked perfectly. It realy seems like this value is wrong by default because the doc (almost) does not talk about it (only in one of two links I sent), from the doc it seems like it’s not influenced by the thrust or weight and the doc only advises to reduce it but it’s already at the minimum.","Yes my altitude was stable before my update message and after (i.e. now), with PSC_POSZ_P=2."
40,20inch props CoaxCopter tuning issue,1,Hi everyone. I got the CoaxCopter ready for a maiden but I am a bit lost on the tuning. I am doing in in Stabilize and the Yaw feels beautifully responsive (expected) but Pitch and Roll are uncontrolable: seems they overshoot. Any advice on the method or should I follow one of the traditional quadcopter tuning methods?,*

The problem is that your radio is not set properly. When you thrust up, it’s doing the yaw movement. By default ardupilot considere the channel 3 of you transmitter as thrust, see the doc on the basic RC channels here to set your radio : * You can either change your radio to send thrust on channnel 3 or tell ardupilot to considere channel 4 as thrust. Of course do this for every channel and check that Pitch/yaw/roll/thrust are all at the right place. You can see what ardupilot is recieving as pitch/roll/yaw/thrust in “radio calibration”."

43,Does Autopilot placement matter above or below CG?,1,"I am running into a very strange issue and my only thought right now is that placing an autopilot below center of gravity versus above may make a difference. Could anyone comment on this? In the past all of my single copters had autopilot placed above CG. This time I made a single copter with a very heavy battery placed high, so the autopilot ended up below center of gravity. No matter what I do, what the PID settings are I cannot eliminate huge oscillations and immediate crashes right after taking off (in Loiter, Alt-Hold or Stabilize). What’s strange is that on a PID tunning stand it works fine. Just like my previous single copters. The stand has a horizontal shaft that goes through the center of gravity of the copter. I push the top of the copter by hand or I apply flaps to get it off balance and it returns to the upright position right away without any oscillation. With some PID settings it may swing a bit past upright once, but that’s it. No oscillations whatsoever. Unfortunately the moment it takes off, it starts swinging like crazy and quickly crashes.

One log below: *","Unfortunately Ryan, I still have no answer to this problem. I’m not even sure whether the main cause is the placement of the autopilot. I’m beginning to believe that this behavior may be caused by having CG and large mass close to the controlling surfaces (flaps). On a test rig there is no problem, but in free flight each time flaps try to upright the copter this also moves the CG (and autopilot) sideways, which affects the autopilot. This would be very unfortunate because this forces the design to become long (tall) with CG far away from the flaps. Perhaps there are some parameters that could “desensitize” autopilot from those side motions but I have no idea what those parameters are. By saying “side movements” I do not mean that they are visible. They are very small but theoretically they are larger than those when CG and autopilot are far away from the flaps. I’m speculating. The truth is that at this stage I’m lost."

44,ATC_RAT_PIT_FILT is it safe to change it from default 20 to 5?,0,"I have a relatively large, 5 kg single copter. It requires high P and D values for PID tuning. This however makes flaps chatter/vibrate and rattle after arming. Reducing FILT value for Roll and Pitch below 10 makes flaps work smoothly and the chatter is reduced a lot. At FILT = 5, chatter is completely gone. My concern is whether such low FILT value is safe. I’d hate to destroy the copter on its first flight. I’d really appreciate your advice in this matter.",

I’ll make some logs soon and will post them. Yesterday I noticed something else: after I force Armed the controller, the servo #5 moved to it’s Minimum Position of 1040 PWM as I set it in Mission Planner. This lasts for a second or two after which time the autopilot disarms itself which makes the arm go back to position 982 PWM. As mentioned before, in position 982 servo would be damaged because it would keep pushing against the idle stop in the carburetor. I am beginning to think that the initial 982 position is a safe fail position established during ESC setup. I forgot to mention that I am using an autopilot with the settings which I flew with an electric propulsion. I did not want to write again all the PIDs and other customized settings so I kept it. The program thinks that there is an ESC there. This is why I’m asking what I should change for a gasoline engine.

OK, I just changed the MOT_PWM_MIN to several different values, one of them really large (1800).After each change I rebooted the controller and verified that the new value was accepted. I see no difference in Servo5 behavior. Here what happens:  after autopilot is powered the Servo5 arm goes to around 980 PWM position. after I force arm the autopilot, the arm moves to position about 1100 PWM after autopilot disarms the arm goes back to position 980 PWM  I also changed one parameter which I found: MOT_SAFE_DISARM from 0 to 1 but with no effect so I switched it back to 0. When I changed SERVO5 function from 37 to 70 (it says it’s a Throttle), the arm does not move at all so I went back to 37.

I selected Frame Class: Single Copter and Frame Type: Plus I set: SERVO5_MIN to 1080, SERVO5_MAX to 1745, and SERVO5_TRIM to 1080 (same as MIN) MOT_PWM_MIN to 1080   Before Arming the motor ch5out shows 1080 as expected. After Arming ch5out goes to 1146, so does servo arm (difference of 66 PWM).  After disarming ch5out moves back to 1080. At max throttle ch5out goes to 1711 instead of 1745; also the servo arm is initially erratic but these I will work on later. After I changed Servo5_Min, Trim, and MOT_PWM_MIN - all of them to 1180, the ch5out jumped to 1236 after arming, and went back to 1180 after disarming (difference of 56). The 982 PWM that I mentioned earlier happens to be the radio PWM (ch_in). So there is still the issue of PWM increase above set Servo5_MIN and MOT_PWM_MIN after arming. As you pointed out, function 70 (throttle) does not work for servo5. I also wanted to replicate the settings that Canberra UAV uses with a tricopter with a petrol engine (*) but cannot find the ICE_ENABLE or THR_MIN parameters in my single copter frame. In fact I cannot find any parameters related to an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) or to a throttle. Are they not available for that frame or I am doing something wrong?

In Arducopter 3.6.10 I cannot set MOT_SPIN_MIN same as MOT_PWM_MIN because it accepts values from 0.0 to 0.3, so I set it to 0 (was 0.15).  I also set MOT_SPIN_ARM to 0 (was 0.1) Now before arming, after arming, and after disarming the servo5 PWM (ch5out) are all the same values. No jumping up after it’s armed. I also set MOT_SPIN_MAX to 1 (was 0.95). This made the PWM at max throttle go all the way to the set value for MOT_PWM_MAX.  Two birds in one stone! Thank you! Unfortunately another problem surfaced, or I just did not pay attention to it earlier: initially after I start moving the throttle stick up, and later on when I slowly bring it all the way down, servo arm (and ch5out) does not follow the throttle stick in the low range. It follows only from about mead range to max. Going up from idle and coming back to idle, there is a delay. Especially on the way back. The stick is all the way down but the servo5 arm stops about 150 PWM above MOT_PWM_MIN, then moves briefly a little higher (I noticed at this moment the flaps move to trim positions) and only then servo5 arm goes to MOT_PWM_MIN. I have no control over it. What parameter would control this? What would eliminate it? I’m sure there is a reason for this behavior but is it needed with an ICE? Or perhaps Stabilize mode is not the mode I should be using during setting up all the parameters? I have a feel that for an ICE engine it would be best if I could disable arming of the motor all together (don’t know how yet). I do need to be able to precisely control engine rpm in the low range with my radio, especially during starting the engine and during warming it up. I prefer not to pass thru the radio signal for this because I need the MOT_PWM_MIN in MAX to keep servo from crashing into the stops in the carburetor. Any suggestions?"

In fact all of the advises I received from everyone when put together made it finally work. I want to thank everyone for this. Time to fill up the tanks! On a side note:  I cannot find the ARMING_REQUIRE parameter. This may become dangerous because the motor gets automatically disarmed when throttle stick is all the way down (=982 PWM). I have a separate kill switch for this. For testing on a test rig it’s OK though. when I move the flaps, throttle increases automatically. I understand this is to compensate for the lost thrust caused by the flaps.

After about 20 seconds of holding the throttle at minimum, the system disarms and I lose control of the throttle. The manual says that disarming takes place when the stick is at minimum AND being held fully left for 2 seconds. In my case just the stick at minimum for about 10 secs disarms the throttle (motor). No left is necessary. For a gasoline engine it is necessary to be able to keep engine at minimum throttle without disarming. This is needed to warm up the engine. An ICE engine needs a kill switch anyway. Is there a parameter that will prevent disarming when throttle is kept at minimum?"

It pertains to an electric version of a single copter. Explanation: When a single copter is landing, a tall copter is tipped over by even a slightest wind. The reason for that is that before disarming, the motor still generates thrust making the copter practically weightless. Consequently the wind drags the copter sideways with one or more legs already on the ground. Once a leg catches any obstacle, the wind tipps the copter over. The simplest way to sit the copter firmly on the ground would be to manually kill the motor the moment the copter touches the ground. This should be possible in any mode, including RTL. In a petrol engine I kill the ignition directly from Rx, bypassing the autopilot. My question is: What would be the best way to do that in an electric copter without bypassing the autopilot? I think that killing the motor should be done by a switch in the radio. What parameter would allow to do that? Any suggestions?"

Under Frame Class in QGC you can select Single Copter.  From Frame Type select “Plus” - this is critical. After you select Plus, you go to Parameters, Tools and click on Reboot Vehicle. You may also hard reboot it.  I found this to be the most reliable way of loading all single copter parameters. After that you can do all your calibrations in Mission Planner. I know that you can select Frame_Class 8 in Mission Planner under Advanced Parameters, but I’m not sure how well this works or whether this is enough. To check your servo functions under Advanced Settings, find Servo1_Function, and check if the assigned number corresponds to Motor1 (if I remember correctly). If not assign the Motor1 number. Do the same to Servo2_Function (assign motor 2), servo 3 and 4. Please remember that you will not see the flaps move until you Arm the autopilot first, so you need to calibrate your copter or disable some features that are needed for Arming. I’m not an expert here so please don’t be surprised if this info is not entirely correct. Please let me know how it goes. I assume you are familiar with this: *"

I’ve never used QGroundControl, so it sounds like that is a way to go. I’ll have to try it out. One thing I discovered that you mention, and I think this was half my troubles, reboot the board. I was getting frustrated because every evening upon returning to the project, the state of affairs was different and that was because the last changes I made before turning off the board would take affect. This past weekend, I got the board armed got the outputs I was expecting. Just this evening I constructed a crude mock up of a SingleCopter. All functions as described except the yaw control seems to be really unresponsive, sure the control surfaces move, but a lot slower than pitch and roll. Maybe that is a function that will sort itself out in the air. I also loaded CoaxCopter (Frame 9) onto the board. It functions as described except for yaw. When inputting yaw, none of the control servos move as expected, but the motors do not change speed as suggested in the documentation. Thanks for your help. I’ll be posting photos and instruction of my build just so others can follow along this adventure.  David"

I am finally controlling the carburetor of the gas engine the way I need it, but after installing my single copter on a test rig for PID calibration, other things don’t work. I did not have these issues with my electric single copter. I’m suspecting that something went wrong with loading the frame type, or the latest software is not quite the same as older version I used in my electric copter. To tune PID for pitch, the test rig restricts motion in all axis except for pitch. At rest the copter slightly pitches down.  When I give it gas the flaps try to pitch it even further down instead of straightening it up. I have to grab it to prevent it from spinning around. It is as if the direction of rotation of flaps is reversed - but it is not. Before arming the motor, flaps 2 and 4 rotate correctly. I did however had to reverse direction of rotation of flaps 1 and 4 but they play no role in this tuning (surprises me because in my previous copter (electric) all flaps moved correctly and did not need reversing). I observed that after arming the autopilot, but before arming the motor, flaps will respond to radio commands for pitch and for roll but not for yaw. They will not respond to throttle either but that’s understandable. After engine/motor is armed flaps do not respond to any commands from radio and adding throttle even a little bit sends flaps 2 and 4 forward, to make the copter pitch down regardless of copter’s vertical orientation (whether it’s tilted forward or not). So my main question now is what cases the autopilot not try to upright the copter but rotate it in the opposite direction? On a side note - in gas engines there is very little thrust till almost 3/4 of open throttle, so it would be helpful if the flaps got activated for auto mode at about 1/2 way up the throttle (or more). Is there a parameter that controls when they go into auto mode? Log file: * (456.0 KB) Thank you, Andrew"

In fact, on a stand, I cannot make flaps move all in one direction to create yaw. I’m using the latest software and I’m thinking that it may have something to do with it, but I’ll wait till I hear from Peter Hall. His advises are right on the money. What version of Arducopter are you using? You said the flaps in your copter respond to the throttle stick for yaw. Just they don’t move a lot… Is this happening after you arm the motor, or before? In my case the flaps do not respond to the yaw stick at all, but they respond to pitch and roll. Unfortunately my electric copter that flew well is in pieces so I cannot go back to it and check."

For a single copter. If you were trying to fly a single copter on the coax copter code then it does make a difference.

Next what I will do:  Will reload the Firmware Version V3.6.10 (or the latest) to the autopilot to verify the behavior. If no change, I will load the same firmware to my small electric single copter to verify. This copter flew well before, with the V3.2 firmware. If still no change, I will try to find and download the old V3.2 firmware and will load it to my small copter to verify.  May take me a week or so to do that as the small copter is in pieces. The large one with gasoline engine is mounted on an rig outdoor. It’s freezing already in my place so I’ll do most of the work indoor on the electric copter and will report the results."

The flaps will not move at all when I move the yaw stick.  This is tested after I press the arm button and the red light turns solid. No motor is armed yet.

In my new gasoline single copter, the flaps do not respond to the yaw stick until motor is armed. After arming the motor yaw works and the flaps move in the correct direction (obviously with some delay and not quite proportional to the stick because at this point the autopilot is trying to balance the copter). Firmware is 3.6.11. The flaps do respond to pitch and roll though before arming (need to press safety switch first). In my older copter (firmware 3.5.4) all three: pitch, roll and yaw respond to the sticks before motor is armed. It may have nothing to do with firmware. Would you happen to know what parameters I should check/compare between the two copters to make yaw work before arming the motor? The same radio is used in both copters. For the gas copter I’m switching direction of one channel in my radio because the servos rotate in the opposite direction. The green bars under radio setup screen in Mission Planner move identically in both copters - exactly as you instructed earlier: all bars move in the same direction as the sticks except for pitch. Pitch moves the opposite direction. I don’t know if it is critical to make yaw work before arming but it helps in making sure that everything is set correctly for a single copter. 2. After arming the motor, flaps start working only after throttle is above certain PWM. Which parameter controls the RPM that activates the flaps? I’d like to increase that value."

Frankly - if I can try pitch and roll on the ground, why yaw would not be allowed? Helps a lot during the initial setting. Lets you make sure the directions are correct, establish stops etc. Doing it after arming is not that easy and not accurate.   The point is not to try to stabilize the copter before throttle is quite high, and better if it’s done automatically, not by a switch (that is if I understand correctly how the motor interlock works). When flaps are active before the thrust is able to lift the copter, they tend to tip the copter over because landing legs hold the copter while auto is attempting to balance. In a single copter the copter must be in air, nothing touching the ground in order for the flaps to do their job. The bottom of craft must be able to move freely. When flaps start balancing prematurely they just create a side force that tips the copter over. The same during landing. It’s like stepping on you shoe laces  This is why I was asking if there is a parameter that allows to delay that till throttle is further up. So far the only option was to give a single copter almost a full throttle right away to make it jump of the ground. Not the best procedure for take off. A gas engine is more sluggish so I expect problems here.  "

Going through the paper now.  If a serrated, tapered trailing edge is good enough for whales, it’s certainly good enough for me.  I think the paper concludes that the blunt trailing edge suffers something called “lock on” under certain conditions.  The serrations attenuate the vortices that contribute to this effect, while the sharp trailing edge has less of them in general?  I suppose these vortices and lock-on could contribute to fluttering fins?  Thanks again Mike, Paul"

Now have the machine flying a complete mission from take-off to landing.  Well, almost.  It tip overs on most landings. My theory is that with the flight controller located directly above the inlet of the prop shroud, it is subject to unwanted pressure changes - especially in ground effect when there must be back pressure.  This makes it difficult for the flight control software to accurately estimate the final landing rate of decent and it therefore does not turn off the motor.  Here is the Arducopter (singlecopter) dataflash log excerpt showing the spike in the barometric altitude as it nears the ground.  The crash is after it tips over. The data above came from a subsequent flight where I had lightly wrapped the flight controller in foam in hopes to keep the wind off it. Anyway, very close now…"

58,Coax 360° Yaw behavior,0,"Hello, I playing with a coax V3.6.7( and i have a strange behavior on yaw axis, it fly well (if a coax could fly well ) but after moment it start to turn left on yaw, if i let it done it make a 360° yaw and then i can stop it and i regain normal flight up to the next complete 360° yaw???.. when i look to the logs it seems that its the system that want to do that??? I put the logs of the flight with the strange behavior. moreover as i use it in indoor flight in metallic environment, how i can disable mags in order to use only gyro (headlock)? You will see in logs bad mags despite several mag calibrations. Thanks for your help… *",
