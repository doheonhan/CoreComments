1,About the Copter 3.3 category,1,Discussions and support requests for Copter 3.3,"I would like to assign the RC10 to the sutter using the camera trigger. However, the parameter can not be stored in the designated RC10. Can I modify it directly in the full parameter? Or can you send me the modified parameters? firmware : coter 3.3.3 (HEXA) my camera : sony from qx-1 FC : pixhawk transmitter : tananis 9 module : Seagull #REC"

In the meantime, the Mission Planner application is connected as UDP and 57600. Where am I making a mistake please can you help?",You are better off compiling the SITL yourself. And you should decide if you want to use plane or copter. You mention plane in the commands and on the text but you also talk about copter and you posted on a copter thread. What is it Plane or Copter??? And please update to 4.0.7 or 4.0.9

3,ArduCopter attitude controller ef to bf conversion,1,"I am very new to ArduCopter and am trying to understand how the attitude control works. As a starting point, I am using ArduCopter 3.3 since it uses Euler angles instead of quaternions. I am confused about converting ef angle errors to desired bf angular rates. The following is in relation to angle_ef_roll_pitch_yaw method. My thought was that I would first compute ef angle errors, multiply those by respective proportional gains to get desired ef angular rates. Then I would transform the desired ef angular rates to desired body frame angular rates. However, going through the angle_ef_roll_pitch_yaw method, it seems that first ef angle errors are computed and those are then transformed into body frame. And then the corresponding proportional gains are applied to get desired bf angular rates. I do not understand that part. I thought one can convert ef angular rates into bf angular rates, but as mentioned above the code applies the coordinate transformation to the ef angle errors and not angular rates. We know that multiplying by proportional gains before the transformation is not the same as multiplying after the transformation. I would greatly appreciate any input in this regard! That will help clear up my confusion. Thanks!",Take a look at: * * there are lots of information about the control loops. And if you want to implement your own controller take a look at: *

6,Need Help/Feedback PID Tuning Large Hexacopter,1,"Hi everybody! I’ve got a large 1280mm hexacopter, Multistar 5008 330Kv motors, 18x5.5 props. I’ve got it tuned pretty decent in stabilize, but in PosHold (Pixhawk running 3.3) it’s slow and mushy when it brakes. While in PosHold, I think because of the large wingspan, the amount of time it takes to roll or pitch into the brake angle takes much longer than normal. It’s kind of like I need to speed the rate of roll and pitch when braking in PosHold. I’ve got PHLD_BRAKE_RATE set to default (8) at the moment, tomorrow I’m going to up that one digit at a time and begin slowly increasing I and D via Ch6 to see how it responds. My question is with a copter this large, is there anything else I should be considering while trying to PID tune? I’ve tuned many smaller quads and hexes, but this 1280 is nothing like what I’ve dealt with before. Any help or feedback is GREATLY appreciated! Dan *",I welcome you! I hexacopter-pitch propellers and 90cm 15x55 and also I have a problem with the length of braking.

I didn’t autotune, mostly because I had no confidence to in being able to keep it up in the air long enough without crashing, it was very unstable. The good news is that I figured out the the arm tubes weren’t thick enough, there was wayyyyy too much flex which is why it was behaving like that. I upgraded the frame to one with thicker arms (20mm instead of 16mm) and now it flies perfectly, no problems at all. Thank you for your feedback, and for being so helpful."

7,Loiter_Unlimited next command,1,"Hi all, I currently have the following commands on my mission.  Takeoff Loiter_Unlimited WP  According to the article on the MAV_CMD: The mission will not proceed past this command while in AUTO mode. In order to break out of this command you need to change the mode (i.e. to MANUAL). If there are subsequent commands then you can continue the mission at the next command, if the Copter MIS_RESTART parameter is set to resume, by switching back to AUTO mode (otherwise the mission will restart). However, I wasn’t able to do so. The only way I can get it to WP 3 is from the Mission Planner. Which is not really ideal for my project. Is there any other way I can achieve this from the transmitter? Thanks!","I have just confirmed this misbehavior, running the simulator in Mission Planner. I created a mission designed to fly to one point on a circle and wait until a mode switch out of, then back into, Auto mode. MIS_RESTART is set to 0 (resume). What I see is that the copter flies to the LOITER_UNLIM point, and then stays there, regardless of the mode switching. I googled this and searched the forum but found only the above reference to what I would describe as a bug. Can anyone provide illumination on the behavior? Thanks."

What behavior are you trying to achieve? Using scripting you could add a RC switch to advance past a loiter unlimited. If you have a GCS you can just advance the mission index directly.  The current behavior is correct, it’s the doc that is wrong. Switching out of AUTO and back will not skip over a mission waypoint.

9,Pixhawk twitchy YAW and not disarm on crash,1,"Hi everyone, hoping someone can help me with my pixhawk problems. I just rebuilt my old quad on a new alien 560 folding frame, after much playing about getting everything CG balanced I took her out for her maiden flight today. (was a bit scary) 1st attempt:- In loiter with 12 SATS Pitched backward, hit the ground flipped over and disarmed itself. 2nd attempt:- Re-calibrated compass’s In loiter 12 Sats, I took off quicker this time getting a couple meters altitude, on takeoff again pitched backwards then settled.

Flight Fottage *",i had a similar experience but my copter settled down after a few second and also on the same flight after going to about 400 ft alt it was a little windy so i lifted my retract to reduce sail area. after a few minutes of hovering in place i went to bring it a little closer  and found that my pitch and roll controls switched my pitch now controlled my roll and roll controlled my pitch. i finally got it closer so i dropped the gear to land and found that the controls had switch back to normal  it was late last night so im going back out to day to see what its going to do

12,SBUS out questions,1,"Hey guys! I have a question for which I am hoping someone can offer some insight. I have a pixhawk driven Hex that is carrying a nex5 on a three axis gimbal with slipring for 360 degree rotation. Due to limited wiring through the slipring, I only have one set of signal wires to run SBUS to my Alexmos gimbal controller. What I would really like to have is at least 4 channels running through the pixhawk sbus out in order to control the gimbal. I currently have my ch 8 in/out set to control the gimbal pitch. I set my CH7 in/out as an RC Passthrough to control my shutter on the camera. I would also like to have a control channel for Yaw, as well as a channel to control gimbal controller modes. My problem is that SBUS out only seems to send out channels 1-8. As it is a hex, my first 6 channels are tied up with ESC motor outputs which only leaves me with channels 7 and 8 to work with. To complicate matters further, I would still like to be able to trigger autotune but I don’t have a channel to trigger it without reconfiguring channel 7 and 8. I did use a PPM encoder to re-encode the servo outputs from the pixhawk, but it added yet another piece of hardware and also introduced twitches to the pitch control so that didn’t seem to be the best solution. Does anyone know if there is any way to send channels 8-14 through the SBUS out on a pixhawk or is there a way to switch motors to run on a different set of channels rather than ch1-6? What would be awesome is to just have all 14 of the channels output through the SBUS out port. Any suggestions?",Can anyone offer any insight on a solution?

I initially powered down and disarmed, checked everything, and started again and the shake, or oscillation in yaw happened again. Giving it more power and lifting off and the oscillations were gone. Does this sound like it. This happened after I had auto tuned the yaw and the PID were quite high but very nice in flight, and I was started to tune Roll and Pitch, initially manually. I had lowered the Roll and Pitch to 3.1 from the default 4.5 when I noticed this oscillation on power up. The copter was also sluggish in the air. Taking back up to 3.9 and no oscillation was evident. Is this anything like what you are seeing?"

14,Over-heating Pixhawk Quadcopter,1,"I have an S500 quadcopter with an original Pixhawk board and standard 3DR style power cable.  I have Sunnysky V2814-11 motors and 60A ESCs (SimonK, as far as I can tell).  I have a printed circuit board power distribution board PDB), a 5,000 mah 3S battery, and a FlySky radio with PPM out of the receiver.  In other words, it is about as plain vanilla as can be.  Everything seems to check out in Misson Planner.  The problem comes when I switch on the power.  After a few seconds, I start to get the odor of burning electronic components, the Pixhawk warms up, the power cable gets warm, one of the ESCs gets noticably warm (the one closest to where the battery feeds into the PDB), and the first time I turned it on, the motor attached to the warm ESC started to smoke.  At that point, I immediately switch off the power.  I have swapped out the ESC and motor that seemed to have over-heating problems, with the same results.  I never had these problems with my 3DR Y-6 with APM 2.8.  What could be happening with the Pixhawk system?","Not on pixhawk system , there is problem on your pdb board or you soldier swipe the + and - wire to battery original + and - look at the red goes to red and black goes to back i mean pdb say + so red wire and - = black wire Happy flying "

After two weeks and two full rebuilds, yesterday I was analysing the logs, and realized that the position ( pos ) was jumping around 10 - 15 meters. The Ekf logs has shown that ekf3 ( ivn, ive and ivd ) innovations were high, besides the fact that the VIbrations 3.3 graph were inside recommended range. Since mainly only GPS and IMU could be the cupid and the vibrations logs were fine, I was trying to deal with it by playing with the gps. I’ve changed several settings, enabled and disabled glonass, sbas and nada. So I tried something more radical. Held the drone with my hand , letting loiter try to release it ( like hell ) wile standing still. The result was that I have almost a SOLID dot in the logs, showing that GPS were always right about the position. Good! Now the only thing left: Virbations. Changed the 3m foam to  kiosho gel tape and the virbrations were almost gone for good. Today I’ve tried to fly and IT WAS GOOD!! After two weeks, i’m so happy that i have figured it out! Lession learned and something for the devs to think about. We should find a better way to determine that vibrations are affecting the performance in addition to the vibe levels. The vibration levels were always below 10m/s/s . THe wiki recommends something below 15m/s/s as normal. Now time to get back to PID gains. I’m planning to try autotune with the new vibration levels."

Try increasing the MOT_SPIN_ARMED value from 70 to something higher like 90 or 100 (don’t go above 130). If the motors stop spinning once the pilot throttle is above zero then the THR_MIN may also need to be increased from it’s default of 130.  Maybe try 150 or 170.  Going over 200 shouldn’t be necessary.

Did you recalibrate your escs ? Do you have a bench where you can measure the thrust and see if they are all the same? Did you also calibrate the accelerometers, by clicking on “Calibrate accell” and “Calibrate level” in mission planner? If you move your right stick when the throttle is about to takeoff , would the copter respond right to your inputs ( roll / pitch ) ? If you did all the tests, and you are pretty sure that all the setup are right, I would try to takeoff by compensating the movement using the right stick for that. If you consider to try that, you need to be confident in your flight skills and need to have a place that would minimize any damage to the model ( i like soft glass or mud) and to yourself , in case  something bad happens. If you are able to takeoff this way, then you could trim the model to be level and hover still. After that, next take off would be ok."

Blades, are they new? i.e. have you flown with them before. From the video they look awfully like HK carbon blades. (correct me if I’m wrong) if they are the ones I think they are they kill the U5 motors. They cause them to ‘lose step’ and play havoc with the ESCs. Also they are 48% less efficient than the T-motor blades. (I have done a LOT of testing) From video it also “sounds” like PIDs are too high for those motors / blades. Again I may be wrong at its only a quick snip of sound just before you kill motors. Fatly Pixhawk?  Unlikely, they (in my experience) are reliable; the pre-arm checks should catch any drastic failures. (256 hours of flight logged with them over 6 rigs, and only one crash so far, which appears to be a power fail) Any more info you could provide albeit insignificant in your mined could reveal something.

I understand your point of view regarding the current state and the shelf, but my opinion is that there is still some work to be done in your setup. After that it will fly smoothly since the very beginning. All the drones that I’ve build had a similar behaviour on the very first flight. I would rather take-off and feel what needs to be setup than trying to set it on the ground. How about your propellers ? ACPUK has raised some interesting points. What esc/firmware are you using? How is your center of gravity  ?  is it well balanced? How was the test regarding pitch/roll response on the ground? In stabilize,  with 25% of thrust, if I command roll or pitch, I can see my X6 raising the landing gear a little bit off the ground accordingly. This is an important test to see if it is reacting well."

If they are like the same, definitely it is not an HW problem ( assuming that all the connections are solid ) If you don’t have a thrust stand, an  chinese luggage scale would do the job. just hold an arm under the motor being tested  with the scale and measure the lift force.

20,Control ONLY brushless Gimbal with Joystick,1,"Folks, I’ve been up and down the forums and it seems that for YEARS no one has figured out a way to control a brushless gimbal with a Joystick/Gamepad on channels above 8 for copter.  Bear in mind that no one in their right mind is able to fly without lag using a gamepad.  I’ve noticed that when anyone has tried to say they want to only fly with a gamepad and no RC, they get dismissed (rudely actually).  Since the control is a bit laggy using the gamepad,  The most useful function for such a device would be to do something non flight critical, like point a camera. I’ve been pointing my brushless Zhiyun z1 tiny 2 3-axis gimbal in yaw and pitch by using the sliders on my RC controller just fine after configuring the RCX option as RCPassThru (option 1) in the params list.  Fine it works.  But it would be much better if I could enable joystick ONLY on specific channels (i.e. 9-12) and let a friend play with the camera while I do the flying. So two questions I guess:   Why can you only enable joystick by completely disabling the RC controller   Why does (even when the joystick is enabled) it only let you control channels 1-8 ??   For number 2, I’ve even gone so far as to try to manually edit the joystickaxisArduCopter2.xml file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Mission Planner folder, where even if you manually add something like:  9 None false 0   10 Rx false 0   11 Ry false 0   to the end of the file, this is ignored. I’ve calibrated my joystick in Windows.  I’ve calibrated my Radio with the joystick enabled.  Been through roughly what looks like the last 5 years of Q/A about Joysticks and Gimbals and no one has figured it out?  I even posted in the DIYdrones forums, got 30 views and not a single response.  Weird, for something that would seem about the most simple desired function on a copter typically who’s purpose is to collect video. *","Not sure about copters but we do this with planes, i.e. manual RC or autonomous flight with simultaneous joystick gimbal control. However we do use RC6 and 7 for pan and tilt so that may not answer your questions about ch9+. We’re only using 5 channels for control, roll, pitch, thr, yaw + mode, ch6 is flaps but it’s direct, not through the flight controller."

The inconsistent compass message is because the vehicle’s arming checks have found the internal and external compasses aren’t pointing in the same direction.  They’re off by at least 30degrees.  It’s probably because of lots of metal near the internal compass.  You can try calibrating it but if that doesn’t clear it up you may need to just disable the internal compass (COMPASS_USE2 = 0). The EKF’s compass variance is because the primary compass’s (usually the external one) vector isn’t moving consistently with the other sensors (ie. accelerometers and gyroscopes).  This can be a temporary thing - for example if you plug in the vehicle while it’s on a car roof, the moment you move the vehicle away from the car the EKF will complain.  If it’s more permanent, for example if it always climbs when you rotate the vehicle in a relatively metal-free environment then there may not be much that you can do about it.  As long as the EKF compass variance doesn’t go into the red (i.e. > 0.8) then it’s probably ok.  If it’s going red then we should check the COMPASS_ORIENT parameter matches the compass’s orientation.  Another compass calibration in a metal free environment may help.  Finally I’d probably ask you to try the new experimental compass calibration that includes “scaling” (current calibration only does “offsets”)."

I may have done that (can’t remember for sure). Thinking back I also might have entered a manual declination after doing the live calibration. That makes sense about the metal. One thing I noticed looking at the logs, the compass EKF bar stays near the bottom while the craft is pointed south (the direction it was pointed when it was armed), but when the craft started coming back towards me (pointed north), the EKF went up quite a bit. There’s no way that could be the declination or calibration? Has to be metal interfering?"

That merely tells the system which way is north, but the problem you’re having is more basic than that, it’s detecting a problem with the way the vector is moving. Randy: could not the compass EKF going bad in flight have to do with mag field changing in flight due to current through the power wiring?  That would cause the mag field to move around, and may be upsetting the EKF?  Doing CompassMot procedure may help?"

There does appear to be a problem with frame alignment. Motors 1, 3 and 6, your clockwise motors, are lower than 2, 4 and 5, your counter clockwise motors. Are the props the same? Are the ESC producing the same rpm for a given PWM value?  Are you aware that you are flying an ‘X’ frame not a ‘+’ frame?

It could have been a brownout and the log has ended before that. Also you should take care of the vibrations. They seem to be very hight and also some clipping is occurring , which is not good.

32,Autotune Crash,3,"Hi all, I have been upgrading some of my rigs from the crappy Dji A2 to the PixHack  and Pixhawk FC. YES UPGRADING. I have has an unfortunate crash during an Auto tune. This is a large H8 T-Motor U7 400kv 15x5 blades, 2x 16,000 6 cell. BeSteady gimbal. I have test flew the rig a few times with the default PIDs and it flew relatively well on the defaults. It was time to run an Auto tune which I have done several times on other rigs. First part I had the Autotune bitmask set to 1 for the roll. This went very well and gave me very sound results.

I did not spot the vibrations in the log. I did a live Vibration test from MP and the bars stayed very low. Clearly this needs addressed. There is a cut off from in the log. the batteries were thrown out at the 6th flip. May I ask how you derived ""Test: VCC = WARN - VCC min/max diff 0.395v, should be <0.3v"" Is this part of the auto Analysis? I suspected the power to be the issue all along. But when I compared graph from another log powered from the USB it looked as if it had the same fluctuations. My initial thought was the power module failed  causing the crash. Hence the re-build has triple power supply. Thank you again for looking at this for me. Most appreciated. Regards Anthony"

Yes, it was from auto analysis I think Missionplanner hasn’t been updated to handle the new time format on the logfile from arducopter-3.3 on the stable version. To make it work, go to config/tunning and mark the checkbox ""beta updates "" . After that, you can force an update going to   help - check for BETA updates . After  it should work. I never did the vibration test in MP, but I would be best to guarantee that the vibe levels are within normal range through graph analysis. Analysing again your power graph, it seems that most of the time the voltage keeps oscillating between 5.3 and 5.2v which is normal, however there is a few peaks going to 4.9v. The board should run fine in 4.9v, but it it is oscillating it could have went to  a lower level , thus  triggering the odd behaviour. Regarding the log, looking to the pitch att graph looks like it  hasn’t recorded the loops. My guess is that autopilot has crashed before the batteries were ejected. Keep in mind that autotune push the machine to its limits. That could trigger many failures that could  happen in a normal flight. Do you have a power module? I could not see any data regarding the current draw. Regards, Fernando"

Yes I do use a power module but I don’t supply the ESC from it as it is a large rig and can easily pull 250A if motors go full power so could not risk blowing the unit. I do however have a hall effect current sensor installed. Just not set up a voltage divider to limit the voltage swing for the pixhawk ADC. I will be installing a new power module as it is the most likely cause. The low spikes could cause a brownout. I am also installing a triple redundant power setup. Power in, USB in and RC out rail. Just a little confused on weather I need the Zener diode for triple power, I suspect I do. The power will be 3x ubec units. Just not sure as yet which way to set them up as I want power backup for the companion computer also. (which was not connected during the Autotune, likewise the Lidar) I also discovered a chunk of carbon fiber jammed under the FC which may have caused the vibrations. The rig is re-built now so have to suss out the power this evening ready for test flight and autotune tomorrow."

Thanks Anthony","Hi, I have a large experimental quadcopter that is 3m long and 1.3m wide, using 4 of 22 x 8 props and 4 of 6S 8000mAh batteries, all connected in parallel. It was running a Pixhawk clone, but now a Radiolink Pixhawk and GPS. The original Pixhawk started loosing its horizon, and the drone would lean left and land heavily. I changed over to the new controller 2 days back, and after all the calibrations and setup, the drone was flying ok on Stabilise and Altitude Hold, but on Position Hold it would start to oscillate, lean left, pitch forward, lean right and pitch backward, around and around getting worse. I decided an Autotune would probably fix the problem. When I invoked Autotune, (all axes), The drone started pitching left and Right like it should. About 1 min into the Autotune, the drone suddenly went into  a rapid roll, and rolled about 3 times before hitting the ground with lots of damage. Logs end part way into the Autotune Roll Left at about 12° of lean. Some previous movements were up to 20°. This was not a brown out. Board voltage is pretty stable at between 5,2V and 5.35V, right to the end. The only thing I can see in the logs is that the motor outputs were getting pretty close to maximum, a couple of the motors are running at 1764 average and going to 1954(max) (RCOUT values) during the rolling process. Its possible (but unlikely) that 2 of the motors lost sync together (perfect rolling motion, no pitching). there is actually very little variation in RCOUT for the motors in the final logs, so I don’t expect it was fast motor speed changes, as I’ve seen in other posts. Perhaps it just leaned too far and couldn’t recover. The roll speed was very quick when it was falling. I think it did around 3 complete rolls from about 15 meters in about 1 second. Anyway, I’ve attached the logs if anyone wants to have a look.* (876 KB) Maybe I just need 22 x 10 props?"

Helicopters can lift heavy loads with  ease, are much more stable, can use electric, piston or turbine power, and are considerably more efficient than multirotors."
42,Is it possible to use ardupilot to control quadcopter with 4 gasoline engine?,2,"hi, i wonder if ardupilot is able to control 4 gasoline engines for quadcopter i want to make a quadcopter with heavy lift and gasoline engines are my best choice",Maybe it would be possible with Propellers which have variable pitch like the tailrotor of a heli. Fixed rpm at the engine and changing pitch at the rotor. Still not clear how to yaw. 
42,Is it possible to use ardupilot to control quadcopter with 4 gasoline engine?,3,"hi, i wonder if ardupilot is able to control 4 gasoline engines for quadcopter i want to make a quadcopter with heavy lift and gasoline engines are my best choice","There has been some quadcopters with combustion engine built that way. Differential collective pitch is used for yaw control. And ArduCopter does have support in the dev build for “HeliQuad’s”. Howeiver, the complexity, inefficiency and extra weight of such a system is easily outperformed by a single rotor helicopter. In the world of full-size, the largest and most powerful heavy-lift helicopters on earth are single rotor traditional design. Not multi-rotors. And that applies to RC as well. If you are building this project as a proof-of-concept that it can be done, that is one thing. Multi-rotors are popular in RC because of their simplicity and few moving parts, clean electric power, and the advent of electronics to stabilize them. But if you are building a combustion engine VTOL aircraft for a practical application you will not beat a helicopter with a multi-rotor."

42,Is it possible to use ardupilot to control quadcopter with 4 gasoline engine?,5,"hi, i wonder if ardupilot is able to control 4 gasoline engines for quadcopter i want to make a quadcopter with heavy lift and gasoline engines are my best choice","As I stated, the ArduPilot system can handle gas engines with no problem. And it can fly collective pitch “QuadHeli” aircraft. With direct drive combustion engines the problem is not the autopilot - it is with limitations in combustion engine power and how fast they can change throttle to stabilize it. Combustion engines simply do not have the throttle response time of electric motors, and the bigger the propellers, the slower they respond. So basically ArduPilot fully supports what you want to do. The nature of combustion engines makes it impossible. Unless you use a collective pitch system. And ArduPilot supports that too in the 3.6-dev build with what has been dubbed the “QuadHeli” frame type."

It is human stabilized and maneuvered  by a professional with exceptional balance and skill, in combination with electronic gyros to provide self-leveling of the platform. It only has a flight time of about 3 minutes. So it can be done, but I would say it’s not easy.

They are great for hobbiests, simple to build. Marketing has made them very popular. But they have limitations and are unsafe for manned flight. There has been a divorce between practicality and marketing hype here. You can buy a Russian-built Micron ultralight in kit form for about the same money than it costs for the batteries, ESC’s and drives for a manned multi that probably won’t get out of ground effect and is extremely unsafe. The Micron is powered by a Rotax 503. Cruises at 75 mph. No electronic stabilization required.  Can land safely if the engine fails. No license required to fly it (although you may want to get some flight instruction). I’ve flown the Mosquito ultralight, but this is a better design: I got a chance to look over one of the prototypes two years ago when my wife and I were in Russia. Compare this to girl flying the drone, as far as safety, flight time, practicality, performance and cost. This design has been proven over better than 70 years and millions of flight hours. It has all the safety factors required for manned flight designed-in - the main one being able to land the aircraft safely in the event of power failure."

They are very cool. I chatted with the designer of it. The Russian engineers at the Kamov design bureau of Russian Helicopters have been building coaxial helicopters for many years. One of them, the Ka-26, has the best safety record in the history of aviation. It is used primarily in agricultural applications all over the world and is powered by twin radial engines. The designer of the Micron used the concepts of the Ka-series of coaxials to design it. It is inherently very stable and easy to fly. I was quite impressed with the design. Much more robust than the Mosquito ultralights. The downside is that if you want to get one be prepared to wait at least two years. They debuted at Heli Russia 2016, went into production in 2017 and were almost immediately flooded with orders.   It would be really fun to build a RC version of it to experiment with. There is code for coaxial twin-rotor helicopters, I think it was done with AC 3.3. And I’m pretty sure the tandem heli code in 3.6 could probably fly one."

It is a different concept though. It uses a flybar and the top rotor for stabilization of the head, and a fixed pitch design. A coaxial with CCPM mixing, I’m pretty sure, the tandem heli code in 3.6-dev can fly. Pitt did it with his synchrocopter and it is pretty much the same concept except the rotors being inline with a coax. Once you get away from the multirotor concept of throttling motors for stabilization, and think outside the box a bit, combustion engine power becomes more practical. Here is a turbine powered coax UAV, although I do not know what software is being used to fly it: Being the above coax is from 2006, which was pretty much before the electronic stabilization systems we have now came along, it might not use any electronic stabilization at all. And was built using twin flybar heads. I could not really see the flybar linkages in the video, but I think that’s what it might be."

Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated Kim,"Basically one compass is useless , especially the internal one on the Pixhawk board (or on whatever other board) because it gets false readings as a result of magnetic fields of nearby electrical and electronics components and wires. So if you want to avoid flyaways you need a precise compass reading. That can only happen with a compass chip that is the most faraway as possible from all currents flowing and all magnetized parts (be careful, a magnetized component could even be a metal screw in your compass mount or nearby, causing problems). Then we can add a second external compass (that makes thus a total already of three compasses counting the internal one) to add precision and relliability thanks to the extended Kalman filters (fuses data from multiple sensors to reject false readings). Then you could add even more…no limits."

Is there any documentation on how exactly are multiple (external) compasses handled in the code?

(I doubt multiple simultaneous measurements are used in EKF, but don’t know the code well enough to say that definitevely).   What happens when the primary compass fails (falls off a mast, say)? Does it trigger LAND, or does the autopilot simply shift to the secondary compass?   My basic question is, am I really introducing meaningful redundancy by connecting multiple external compasses?"

Px4pilot from HK… (*) (first time I used this one, already used HKPilot32, 3DR Pixhawk, PixFalcon without issues)   I have an important issue with my setup I can’t find the reason… first time I’ve seen this happen. In STAB mode, when I try to hover, my copter rapidly starts spinning CCW  and loose altitude even if I try to correct with manual yaw / throttle input ! There are no Roll / Pitch deviation and the copter keeps its attitude right. Just a Yaw spin making him fall to the ground. I checked the logs of multiple flights. I can’t fly more than 10-20 sec anyway so I did a lot of test flight at 1-3m height to prevent damages. We can see that the AP is reducing motors 1 & 2  (CCW) while increasing motors 3 & 4 (CW) to correct the yaw spin… but it should do the opposite ? CW motors generate CCW torque ? am I wrong ? Anyway, since copter prioritizes attitude over throttle input… motors 3&4 go to max and 1&2 decrease a lot so the average is below the hover position and copter falls slowly to the ground. I’ve checked the motors layout and spinning direction, MAG/IMU/AHRS datas looks good, when i spin left/right pitch up/down , roll left/right, I can see it’s working as it should on the mission planner HUD. ESC calibration was done and re-done. I tried to check if it could be a battery power failure but Vcc and battery voltage don’t drop that much and I don’t know why it would always spin CCW… CoG of the copter in a 3-4 cm behind the CoT. Autopilot is on top of the CoT. Copter is symmetrical on the roll axis. Motors are not twisted more than the eye can see (1-3° max). I uploaded 2 logs from two differents days… Hope you can find something I missed ! (Sometimes I let the copter on the ground with 20-40% throttle and gave so yaw/roll/pitch input so verify the system and to test the battery on 20+ sec flight as I suspected a power failure at first…) 1st day of flight : * 2nd day of flight : (Big file sorry, I logged ALL data…) : * Thanks a lot !!","Hi, did you solve the Problem?

49,Large quadcopter flip and crash,1,"I will post logs soon, but, trying to identify the cause of a crash with a new build. We are using a Foxtech Devourer 130 with 28"" props. The first flight was ok, it hovered fine and small movements worked OK. You could tell it needed to be tuned as it was quite sloppy, but, it was flying for about 3 min or so without issue. The Second flight I put it up and gave it a little more stick input, when I did this it leaned to the right (as I commanded with right aileron) then when it went back to center it went far to the left then back and flipped itself over before crashing into the ground. I believe the main reason for the crash is high vibrations. The Pixhawk is mounted on the supplied large pads, but, with large propellers it has low frequency vibrations that are probably shaking the pixhawk quite a bit on those pads. I am thinking a more firm mounting solution would be much better for a large quad as the large pads supplied with the pixhawk will probably make the lower frequency larger vibrations even worse than they are.

I had a strange crash that may or may not be related to this setup; I can’t say yet since I haven’t yet finished repairs to try again.

Are we missing something, or is it a limitation of Pixhawk that I don’t fully understand yet? Or have you determined one of your ESC’s/motors are defective, thereby causing the sync issue?

Tomorrow I am going to run one more test using just a Futaba Rx to ensure it is not a pixhawk issue. I have sent an email to patrick and his customer service is excellent. The only reason I am very hesitatnt to blame the pixhawk is, the sync issue does not happen on 6s. Today I tested 12s, 11s, 10s, and 6s. 10s-12s all had the same problem. I uploaded a video below. 6s worked well, although one motor has a lot harder time starting and runs at a lower RPM for some odd reason, but, I suspect that is a separate issue. It is quite disappointing after reading all about how the KDE ESC’s are optimized for their motors. But, a very high pole count motor on 12s is most certainly not an easy motor to drive smoothly. I will let you know tomorrow after I verify that it is not the pixhawk. But again, I don’t see how it would work fine on 6s if it was the pixhawk. I think it’s just the communication of the motor on higher voltage is too high for the ESC. This video is only 50% throttle."

49,Large quadcopter flip and crash,18,"I will post logs soon, but, trying to identify the cause of a crash with a new build. We are using a Foxtech Devourer 130 with 28"" props.

52,Copter Altitude Accuracy,1,"* I have been analyzing the altitude reported by the autopilot to get an idea of its accuracy. In the plot, both MSL and the above ground level (AGL) as reported in the GLOBAL_POSITION_INT message are shown as well as the raw GPS altitude given in the GPS_RAW_INT message. The MSL altitude seemed quite low for the field level where we were flying (according to google earth the altitude at our takeoff point is about 46 m msl).    On examining the autopilot parameters I discovered there is a GND_ABS_PRESS parameter which is the ground pressure for the autopilot to calibrate to.  It was set to 101880.9 Pa while the actual baro at the field was about 101626 Pa. Using those numbers I calculated a correction offset.  Adding that to the MSL alt is also shown in the plot. The last issue I’m curious about is there seems to be a scaling issue. According to the pixhawk raw gps alt, the initial climb was 35 m (from 51 m to 86 m), but according to the MSL altitude (or AGL too), that initial climb was 40 m.

Hopefully this will give added impetus to upgrade.

Would it be a terrible idea for me to calculate that offset after the calibration is complete (when arming) and then set the GND_ALT_OFFSET parameter to try to get better agreement between the two?"

The reason for using the current ground pressure and doing all calculations off of that is that it provides you with a very easy zero’d value. While you could try and model it as a a ISA day, this holds little to no value, as you will never be in an ISA day which means you would need an offset adjustment as you mentioned. However once you’ve gone through the extra effort to include an offset you will find that the math is identical for calculating the altitude. The most useful thing you can do that would actually aide the baro (again this only applies to 3.5 is to provide the OAT to the copter during the preflight in the GND_TEMP parameter. * Almost no users will use this, but with out this we clamp the baro’s estimate of ambient temperature at 35C as it is rare to fly in warmer conditions, and the effect of self heating tends to introduce a larger error."

Any ideas on finding the exact cause of this discrepancy between the watt meter and the pixhawk?","Hi. It is not a pixhaw or software problem, is a power lay-out problem. What happens, especially in big frames like hexacopter F550, with long power wiring, is that the return of part of the currents from the ESCs, they do it by the thin cables that come from the Power Module to the pixhaw. This generates an inverse voltage on the negative cable, which is subtracted from the voltage measurement, which is 1/10 of the actual voltage, so if the battery has 11.3 volts, the sensed voltage will be 1.13 volts, per This is that a voltage of 0.1 or even 0.2 volts generated in this return, produce the effect that the pixhawk detects 1 to 2 volts less of the real, The effect is proportional to the total drone current This I solved by modifying the place where the sensed voltage is generated, “translating” the output resistance of the voltage divider of the Power Module. The small 1.5Kohm resistor in the Power Module, which is connected in parallel between the V sense pin and earth, must be removed. Then connect a 1.5 khom resistor between the same wires, but very close to the pixhaw connector. (You must be very careful in this operation). With this the voltage generated in the cable, due to the return of the ESC current, is subtracted from the voltage of the battery and not of the sensed voltage, becoming negligible its effect. The same can be done with the current sensor, but in this case the resistance is usually 110khom or 72khom, depending on the size of the PM. (The value is the one that is measured with a multitester, between Isense and Earth. After this modification, the voltage and current readings proved to be very reliable and accurate Good luck"

For those looking for an elegant solution, without modifying the power module, at all, I tell you a simple solution, elegant and excellent performance, (better than the previous) I comment that the phenomenon of voltage generated by the return of high currents (when they are small, it is not noticed, but if they exist), will always produce a change in the measurement, dependent on the acceleration Of the engines. An excellent solution, that prevents a flow of current from the ESC’s through the pixhawk,and which results in an accurate voltage and current measurement, consists of intercalating a small resistence (on the order of 3.3 to 12 ohms,I have used 10 ohms) on the negative signal cables or ground that goes from the pixhawk to each of the ESCs. NOT ON THE SIGNAL CABLE, ONLY ON THE NEGATIVE CABLE. This causes the return current of the ESC to find an a relatively large impedance along this path. This resistance is negligible for effects of the command signal to the ESC and everything works perfectly. After several tests, it is concluded that the measurements are very precise, in the whole range of accelerations (0 to maximum trhottle) and independent of the lay-out of the power connections. I hope it will be you useful"

Any ideas on finding the exact cause of this discrepancy between the watt meter and the pixhawk?","Hi Joan, The battery voltage is normal to rise when the quad is grounded, since the current is very low and there is no voltage drop to the inside of the battery due to the internal resistance. The internal resistance of the battery increases with the discharge and is much worse when it is old or abused. Therefore you must be confident that with this change you are measuring the correct voltage. Regarding your other problem, if everything is well connected, this should not be the cause. As indicated above, the effect on the command signal to the ESCs is nothing. I have tried and tested it on 7 different quads, with Pixhawk and APM2.5, with the same good results. The problem that you indicate, but seems to be a problem of incorrect rotation of the propellers. Check if the connection sequence is correct and also the direction of rotation. Another possible cause, but less probable, if you have not intervened in the programming, can be a problem of calibration of the ESC. ESC without calibration and high vibration are the cause of most stability problems. When assembling, all motors must rotate smoothly and at the same speed. You should also check if the calibration of the accelerometers is correct, especially the leveling. Otherwise the controller “thinks” that it is uneven and tries to level itself correctly. I hope you can solve the problem"

54,What ESCs Support Motor RPM Logging?,0,"Hi, I am using ArduCopter v3.3.3 right now, and I would like to obtain RPM readings for the motors. I saw that there are several ESC messages defined in the firmware in the data log code. They include motor RPM as one of the logging variables. But my IRIS+ does not log these ESC messages currently. I was wondering what kind of ESCs could enable the RPM logging for these ESC messages.",

In comparison, Mission Planner sets a waypoint (home) in front of the takeoff command, then this takeoff is the second command and won’t be overwritten… But this is nowhere documented.

If you have 5000mAh battery drained to 80% it would be 4000mAh of charge to go back to full. The only thing you need to avoid with LiPos is under voltage. So 3.5/4v is the norm for failsafe. You want to avoid under 3.0v as an absolute minimum when under load. Without logs we can’t really help, but I’d guess it’s triggering failsafe too soon. The issue is that the curve from the lipos is non-linear. ie. starts a 4.2, but drops rapidly to a 3.8V range and then has a another increase in voltage drop when running out of steam. you probably find 3.5v (or 3.4v) works better and you get the full use of the energy in your battery. see graph below *"

What I ended up doing is modifying MinimOSD to give me an estimation of remaining flight time. Basically I have:  distance and altitude from launch point (received via mavlink) RTL horizontal/vertical speeds (ArduCopter parameters, fetched via mavlink) projection of discharge rate per second - this is I hardwired capacity to use (battery capacity parameter, reserved mah parameter - used for battery failsafe) initial battery voltage (this is I measure at minimosd power on) So my minimosd shows how much flight time do I have remaining based on how much remaining capacity do I have, discharge rate and how much time will it take to do RTL back. I estimate initial capacity based on voltage, I’ve built kind of discharge curve for my batteries, similar to the screenshot above, so I can start flying with not 100% charged battery.  All good more or less. The thing is that the ArduCopter battery estimation look strange to me, the discharge rate is linear as a function of time, I don’t see why is it so, I would expect this depend on e.g. throttle. The second issue is related to this, if I reduce reserve time, then I run into voltage drop which is on the right side of the chart. Basically if I fly up to my remaining flight time and RTL, voltage drops significantly at the descend stage (and I’m typically flying at 200-300m) so throttle shoots up to 100% and even at these rates quad can’t do a controlled descend. I’ve got a crash when it has fallen from about 10 meters because it couldn’t keep itself even at full throttle. So if you think in terms of battery capacity you should also monitor voltage especially if you’re flying high. E.g. the horizontal RTL speed I have is 12m/s while the descend speed is I think 4m/s (I don’t want to increase it because I’ve heard about issues at fast descents)."

Fly for however long you’ve been flying. Normally i just for a couple of min. Pay no attention to the OSD or whatever other live gauge you have. Based on what you said earlier, you’re well within 50%. Charge the lipo fully, notice how many “mah” it was put in. Take mah from the charger, divide it by however long you flew in minutes. that’s how many mah is needed per min of flight. With your 5000mah, you have 4000mah available for 80%.  5000x80%=4000 4000 divided by the mah from step 4, will give you the number of min you can fly.  So if you worked out 500mah per min, then 4000 / 500 will give you 8 min.  Voltage is not used in the 80% rule, nor should you use it to calculate how long you can fly.  You just need to pay attention not to dip too low.  Recent lipo shouldn’t dip in voltage too much, I completely disabled my voltage warning and fail safe.  I also found the mah estimate on my power module to be off.  I fly with 3000mah lipo, I can safely use 2400mah to get to 80%.  But I had to enter in 3350mah as my lipo capacity for the reading to be correct."

Strange that you disabled Voltage Warning. Low voltage take precedence over calculated power drain for the very reason power drain is non-linear and difficult to measure. You even collaborate that is the case since by adding the ‘fudge factor’ to your battery capacity to make it so. Battery monitoring is an empirical thing.

So if you have a 5000mah battery with a 20c rating it can supply 100amps. 80% of that is 80amps so that is your maximum draw. Apart from that it’s as Bill says, it’s more of a voltage limit than ma limit… I will fly my 5000mah 4s batteries until they are hitting 3.3/3.4 under load and quite often that means putting 5000-5500ma back into them.

Based on that, I am using stabilize mode since they mention that alt-hold uses the barometer which is not reliable indoors. However, stabilize mode requires constant input to maintain altitude, so my simulated copter falls to the ground – because I think the commands I am using are not being received or processed by ArduCopter. So I am still trying to figure out which MAVLink commands to send. Which commands are you sending? From what you said, I guess you are setting EKF_GPS_TYPE to 3 (No GPS use optical flow)? That is what I am using for that parameter. I would guess that doing that would remove the GPS input from the EKF, but I don’t know for sure. If not, you could try adjusting its EKF weights – I would guess that setting parameters like EKF_VELNE_NOISE, EKF_VELD_NOISE, EKF_POSNE_NOISE to their max value might force the EKF to not rely heavily on the GPS. This is not an ideal solution, but it might be something to test out. In any case, without GPS, I would expect the position/orientation portion of EKF variance to grow over time. However, the velocity portions should not rise since they would likely be fed from the accelerometers and gyros. Based on the parameter documentation (*), the variance check parameter (FS_EKF_THRESH) is only for the velocity and compass variance. I’m guess here, but maybe by “compass variance”, they mean the heading variance (which would probably be jointly fed by both the GPS and the compass sensors). So, if you are getting a “ekf variance” error, maybe that indicates that the GPS measurements are still influencing this? I’m not sure. This page (*) also seems to support this hypothesis since it indicates that a heading error will trigger a EKF variance error like you are experiencing. It may be that in this case, your system is not configured to fallback to the legacy estimation system (called DCM). So, maybe by setting EKF_FALLBACK=1 (or by just always using the legacy system during flight by setting AHRS_EKF_TYPE=0) you can avoid this error? Again, everything I’ve said here is just a guess – I have not looked through the ArduCopter source code, so I don’t know how it all works. Let me know how it goes."

Right now I’m trying to do a school project with a drone and some ultrasonic sensors, what I’m trying to do is to avoid collision in a indoor environment. I used a PIC microcontroller to handle all the ultrasonic sensors, and sent all the measures through the serial port, which is connected to a Pixhawk. Until this point everything is going pretty fine, the pixhawk is receiving all the data correctly, but once I got into this point I don’t really know how to continue, as my knowledge of AC is pretty small. I’m not trying to do something really fancy, more something like this:       If any of the data is below a certain threshold, I would want the drone to just pull back a certain distance at the other direction. I thought about creating a new flight mode, based on an existing one like POS_HOLD or STABILIZE and adding some additional code that would compare the data, and execute the collision avoidance sequence if needed. I know that the motors are controlled with a pwm, and that pwm value is set in the AP_Motors library, but there are so many things in that library that I’m getting pretty lost, and don’t know what to do.

67,Waypoint controller produces a large target position delay,0,"Hello, guys, I’m trying to write a self-defined trajectory and utilize the guided mode to let the quads track this trajectory by writing a 2-HZ loop such that each time a new waypoint along this trajectory can be updated. However, I found that the quads cannot track the desired trajectory very well. I got a log to compare the designed position, the desired position (the _pos_target variable in the AC_WPNav class), and the actual position. They are shown as follow. In this image, I just compare the three valuse in the X direction. I use the DAccX variable to denote the designed X position. In this case, I design a sine wave trajectory for the X direction. However, it is seen that the desired position (DPosX) has a large phase lag (means a long time delay). The actual position (PosX) tracks the desired position well, but also has a large phase lag with respect to the designed position.  * So it can be concluded that the controller works well (as PosX tracks DPosX well), but the waypoint command generator has a large phase lag. I dig the code and realise that it may be due to the advance_wp_target_along_track function (called by the update_wpnav). I think it puts too much constraints on the intermediate waypoint. Is there any suggestion to improve the waypoint controller (the update_wanav and advance_wp_target_along_track functions) to avoid the target position delay and yield a fast waypoint response?",
68,Loss of control and warnings after power cycling,0,"Trying to figure out what may have caused a series of faults ending up contributing to a crash.  Background:  We have been testing a sense and avoid system utilizing the TX board along with optical sensor.  Haven’t had any issues until recently.  Sense and avoid is from a third party so not sure if they introduced something or if it is something related to pixhawk/firmware.  We can consistently recreate the error with the following procedure.  Fly, activate sense and avoid, land, power cycle, get bad gyro health warning along with strange changing of altitude display on MP.  Also just before everything goes haywire, we get a clank similar loss of synch on startup - but esc log doesn’t show much other than prop strike - but weird for sure.  The first time this happened we tried flying even after the strange prop/motor slap and had no control in stabilized as soon as we took off. Haven’t done that again!  I have attached the log if anyone is willing to take a peak and provide some thoughts???  Thanks.[*]",
69,"Extreme Roll/Pitch Oszilation, near crash",0,"Hi, I have spent the last couple of months building a X4 from scratch and took it to maiden flight last week. It’s rather big  (18"" props, 3,5kg take off weight) with a rigid full carbon fiber frame. Everything worked fine on first flight (battery A) - I basically took it up and ran AutoTune on Roll Axis as first thing to ensure proper tuning. Then during second flight (Battery B) I ran AutoTune on Pitch Axis - also worked very fine and completed as planned.After it was done with AutoTune I went into stabilize mode and I flew around to test for ~5 minutes very successfully, with no erratic behaviour (at least I did not notice anything). When it was time to land (had reached calculated flight time) I engaged “land” briefly, then changed my mind and engaged “RTL” as it was too far off where I wanted it to land. Of course I could have flown “home” myself, but I wanted to give RTL a try… and this is where things went wrong. Maybe 10-20 seconds after engaging RTL the copter reached the home position, but instead of holding there for a moment and then descending as normal it started to oscilate really dramatically along roll & pitch axis. I mean really dramatically, to me it looked as if it exceeded 45° in angle. It did this for a few oscilations until I panicked (it looked as if it was going loose control imminantely) and threw back in “Stabilize” mode and was able to land safely manually. I did a perfectly smooth third flight thereafter (Battery C) in stabilize mode for another 15 minutes with no issue whatsoever  - so looks to me like an issue that only occurs when in autonavigation mode - I hardly dare to go into auto/rtl mode again because of this… I tried to analyze the log and can clearly see the roll/pitch chaos just after minute 14 - but I don’t know what could have caused this erratic behaviour. Could one of you maybe take a look at the log file and give me some hints as to where to look for the root cause? Thanks so much, Christian * *",

The script is NOT the only part that is responsible for the telemetry on the Taranis. In fact is the dumbest of the 2 parts of the solution. The part that is running on the Teensy does all the heavy lifting. A common issue with Copter 3.2.1 was that the telemetry wouldn’t be sent to a specific port, because the Teensy doesn’t “request” for that to be sent. When the Teensy is in the same port as a telemetry radio, the GCS requests data to be sent (with the frequencies set by the SRx parameter) and so the Teensy also picks up that data stream. If the Teensy is alone in a telemetry port the SRx parameters come into play and must be enabled (or on Mission Planner go to the OSD configuration and manually enable OSD). On 3.3 several things have changed on the messages that are sent on the telemetry stream, and the program running on the Teensy does not know about this, so either sends gibberish to the radio, which in turn the script won’t understand, or send anything at all. When using OpenTX 2.1.x there’s an additional problem with the new telemetry system that started with 2.1, but I won’t go into that now. Also the serial ports on 3.3 are more versatile and can perform several functions other than GCS telemetry, and must be correctly enabled and configured. On one of my PixHawks I have both the Teensy and telemetry radios on different ports and working perfectly. Basically, if you want to keep using that system for the telemetry on the Taranis, you’ll have to either stick with Copter 3.2.1 and OpenTX 2.0.x or ask to the vendor to provide a solution."

Probably not I’m guessing. When it’s all working it sure is slick.

I bought a cheap Android tablet with a stand attached to my Taranis. The purpose of the system with the Teensy began as a basic telemetry system that could replicate at least the same parameters as a OSD could provide. The fact that some basic telemetry is on the radio is just a duplication of the GCS that is more suited to the way I use the drones. Any external solution like the Teensy and the various OSD’s is always following the evolution of Copter, and usually something breaks from major version to major version, until someone comes along and does the required changes. On top of that the Teensy has an additional problem that also has to handle changes on OpenTX, so the Teensy must shoot to two targets, that have different release schedules… I’m involved, with some other enthusiasts, on bringing the original solution to do as much as it did before with Copter 3.3 and OpenTX 2.1.x, but it’s not finished yet. Regarding the comment that is working with 3.3 I sincerely doubt that, just as a small example, try to engage flight mode 17 (called Brake) on APM Planner and see what happens  on the Taranis  edit: regarding the port. Just to make it easy for you, try to have the Teensy in parallel with the telemetry radio and better to use Telem1 port. If not viable just plug the Teensy on Telem2 and set the appropriate parameters on the Full Parameter List."

77,What does this error sound mean?,1,"I am unable to identify what these sounds mean. What is disturbing is that at the end of these sounds it reboots and then ARMS ITSELF with Mission Planner reporting that it is DISARMED. The kill switch will NOT disarm the aircraft.

Firmware version is 3.3.3 Any help is welcome and appreciated! *","The kill switch isn’t supposed to disarm the aircraft, only disable it from arming.  It’s not a ‘kill’ switch.  Just a safety switch that prevents the FC from sending PWM signal to the ESCs. That first sound almost sounds like a reboot after an initial firmware flash or a firmware update.  I think the second noise is the pre 3.3.3. ready tone?  It’s been so long since I’ve had it though."

We have had this error on another bird, the exact same one and we wound up replacing the autopilot.  I’d like to understand the problem even if it means a replacement.  If y’all think it would help I can send some logs. I’m also considering re-flashing with the same version and see if that clears it, then try flashing to the latest firmware.  But these two things still avoids the understanding of the problem so I’d rather you guys get a crack at it first."

79,Sitl simulation,0,"I am not new to multirotor operation but all my experience has been with Naza. I am a real Newbie to Arducopter and Pixhawk. My question is about Sitl Simulation. When I go to simulation in Mission Planner, I choose the Quad and it tells me that it is downloading the Sitl program. Everything looks OK except I don’t seem to know how to actually start the simulation. I saw that HIL could be used for simulation with FlightGear or X Plane but when I follow the directions I have no option to download the Copter in Hil format through MP 1.3.44. I must plead ignorance with this system and request some basic guidance here.  Is the SITL portion of MP a stand alone program or are peripherals required? If not how do I start the simulation. Is HIL not an option in 1.3.44? I read in one comment that there is a Sitl transition underway. Any guidance would be appreciated. ",

81,Trouble shooting erratic divergence along vertical axis,1,"I am fairly new to the multi rotor community, about a year to date, but I have been flying R/C for more than four decades. I am still learning many things about the Pixhawk. Until recently, I have been doing pretty tame close in flights only ranging out a couple of hundred feet and not doing much in the way of data collection.  I have a 2D gimbal with Hero 3.0 for getting some shots. Lately, I am having a couple of problems, the primary problem is flight related and the secondary is accessing my datalogs. While flying in “Alt Hold” or “Loiter”, I have been experiencing poor altitude control. Lateral control seems fine as does yaw, but the quad will lose altitude while traversing and lately while in hover too.  The first events occurred during lateral flight, when going from a hover to lateral flight, the quad would slowly lose altitude, most times well over a meter, once back in a hover it would slowly recover to the approximate original altitude. I am flying tame, not aggressive at all. I tried doing a complete reset/re-cal. and for a couple of flights, all seemed well.  However, then the quad began to lose altitude during hover as well (sometimes abruptly) and feels slow to respond to power increase while trying to recover. I have noticed that this erratic flight behavior is worse during windy conditions.  If the winds are calm the hover problem is much less pronounced.  I always wait for a good GPS lock, which usually only takes a few seconds. These occurrences have become almost routine, to the point that I have grounded myself except for test flights. Due to high winds for the last few days, I have not flown at all. The secondary issue is with my Mission Planner 1.3.41 software. I am trying to access the the logs, to try and diagnose my altitude issue, but When I hit the “Dataflash Log Via Mavlink”, a second window opens and in the “Output” box I get this msg, “getting list of log files… No logs to download”. I have tried to select a file directly by using the “Download selected logs” button, but no joy. There are files stored, I can select them, but they do not load. Bummed. I look forward to the brain trust’s help with this. Peace,Wolf D.","Your biggest issue here is not being able to get the logs, which anyone wanting to help would be asking for. 1st - update Mission Planner to the latest version. 2nd - You haven’t said what version of firmware you have loaded. 3rd - Have you tried taking the SD card out of the Pixhawk and reading it with your computer?"

I am ardupilot copter beginner, sorry for my poor English, hope you can understand what I mean~ Recently I was studying DCM and EKF in the ArduCopter, research for a long time, but I still have a lot of doubts:  I learned that DCM used to be used alone, so, I would like to use DCM alone, test performance, I try to set the parameter EK2_ENABLE to 0, parameter AHRS_EKF_TYPE to 0, parameter EKF1_ENABLE to 0, but connect to ground station after reboot, GCS shows “PreArm: Waiting for Nav Checks”, I don’t know where it went wrong, or that DCM can’t be used alone now, and must rely on EKF? A second question is, what is the relationship between DCM and EKF? also, What is the relationship between ekf1 function method and ekf2 function method in the ArduCoter? I probably know that EKF must rely on the DCM’s a valid tilt error estimate and ekf2 function is another kind of EKF algorithm. But does DCM also rely on EKF?

Maybe include a title like, “Attempting to get Ardupilot running on Bebop” so that it gets through the moderators. We haven’t produced a wiki page which explains how to get ardupilot running on the bebop.  We could take this opportunity to put that together and/or JulienB from parrot can help you.  The tricky bit is that there’s a special usb cable that you’ll need for the first upload.  We will either tell you how to hack that together or perhaps send you one.  They’re a rare item though.

88,UART Disabled output in certain functions,0,"Hello, I am have been using hal.uartD with a ftdi to send data to external computer for year or two. I did all my uart calls in userCode which has worked with success over different apm builds. Recently we have been working with a new vehicle type which needs a little bit of debugging. I added hal.uartD->printf’s in stabliize_run() to see what commands were happening(I added some additional code to stabilize) but I found that the printf’s don’t execute unless I put them in the UserCode functions. This behavior I found to be odd and was wondering if someone could clue me in. thanks currently using Copter 3.3-rc5 for reference",
89,RSSI Pixhawk PX4 & FrSky X8R Receiver,1,"It’s that thorny old problem that so many pilots have trouble with - getting RSSI to work! So, I have a Pixhawk PX4 and FrSky X8R Rx and Taranis X9D Plus Tx. This is what I have done so far:- The X8R RSSI is connected to the PX4 SBUS out port. In the following configuration I have tried using a normal servo lead, and one I modified with an RC network. In Mission Planner 1.3.41 APMCopter V3.3.3 Parameter: RSSI RSSI_PIN        103  (no options for this) RSSI_RANGE   3.3Volts Parameter: BRD BRD_SBUS_OUT  (3 options for frame rate: 50Hz, 75Hz & 100Hz, all tried with no success). I re-booted the PX4 after every change. I cannot obtain any RSSI output. I have measured the voltage output of the X8R when connected to the PX4; with the Tx on it measures 3.19V max, Tx off it measures approx 40mV. Clearly, the X8R is outputting RSSI values. The MinimOSD (connected to Telem 1) always shows 0% RSSI. I also ran QGroundControl v2.9.4, which has an RC RSSI facility; this too always shows 0%. It appears then, that the Telem 1 port is not outputting RSSI data. Is there something I have missed, or is there a fault in the PX4? Assistance with this would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance.","Resolved. Hexa version 3.4.3 has all the RSSI parameters now, which work. Thank you dev team, its appreciated."

Circle radius is 0 because I am an avid automated mission pilot. Circle Radius can now be controlled by the radius param with the Loiter_Turns command. However, if you have a value in the Circle Radius param and place a value in the radius for the loiter_turns command, the two are added together. The issue might have changed for the compass learn but CX-20 thread on RCGroups said to keep it off. Yes a CX-20 is much different than a build but that thread has gone on to not only support CX-20 flyers but multi rotor builds with APM based FCs too. Compass use is indeed on. Battery V of 12.7 failsafe comes from months of trial and error of finding where 78% used is on a 5200mAh 4S battery. GPS is on as well as INS_USE. Matter of fact, INS_USE and INS_USE2 both = 1"

I still think you need to start again with standard params including accelerometer calibration, and then change the things you want like Circle Radius, tuning, etc. You can save your param file, start fresh and compare to see what you want to change. With so many changed parameters it’ll be very hard to pin down a cause for your problem as some parameters affect others in different ways. I still think it’s not hardware as the outputs from the FC to the motors differ so much but I could be wrong. It looks like it’s trying to take off on a 30° slope. Interesting that 12.7v is the value that shows when 78% is used, that’s 3.1V per cell, mine has NO power left at 3.25v per cell as it’s already hit the voltage cliff.

This is a key setup issue since if the CofG is off then the controller is constantly trying to compensate by adjusting power to the motors. Although my CofG was off a little, in my case, this was not the reason. Another possibility is that the motors are not all mounted at the same angle and/or height. I had attempted to repair a couple of props after some unintended ground ploughing. In doing this, at least 1 prop was approx 1/4"" shorter than the others, so the thrust was adversely impacted and the FC was compensating by reducing power to one motor and increasing it to the opposite motor.

95,Waypoint flight route.How to fly along the line?,3,"hi, everyone! I met some problems about tracking error during way point flight in auto mode. I’m using a qudurotor to do a task about WPnav flight indoor recently. The its actual flying route is bad. Compared with the desired route,the tracking error is a little large. the drone flied along a curve obviously,but not a line.the curvature is a little large caused by the tracking error. The picture below shows the detail about actual flight test.  I want to reduce the tracking error, what can I do? do something about PID parameters? or ? Thanks for your help!","I did a test later , the distance was longer than before, and no other different condition in the experiment. It is also a indoor test."
96,Channel out PWM values not balanced,1,"I have a HK pixhawk, ZTW Spider Opto 30A ESCs, and SunnkSky X3108S-720 motors.

If you’re in stabilize mode, then the motors will throttle up with different values depending on the tilt of the copter. You can check the calibration by starting the copter in “all-at-once” calibration mode and throttling through the range. If the speeds match throughout the range they’re calibrated. You can usually tell by the sound and can hear it if one is out of sync. Don’t spend much time at full throttle, as you could damage the motors from heat without the props attached. That being said, I doubt the motor cal is an issue, because you’re using the same ESCs all around they’re probably matched regardless of whether cal worked. What issue in flight are you noticing that you think needs to be improved? Flight logs can help diagnose that."

I would expect variations in the outputs when pitching or rolling, but the values I observed were with the quad level on the ground with no props. Can I rule out differences/problems with the motors? As I understand the channel outputs, this is the PWM value sent to the ESC. Is there any feedback from the motor to the ESC and/or Pixhawk which could influence the Channel output?

Using the dataflash logs or a telemetry log in Mission Planner will be helpful (I don’t recommend flying with a  USB cable attached!) If they’re not matched in hover, it’s usually one of two things. Either the copter isn’t balanced at the geometric center of the motors, or the motors aren’t mounted level (common with round boom frames). Can you check CG and motor leveling and see if you notice anything out of the ordinary? My guess on a 3/4 imbalance is that one of the motors is tilted. Occasionally, it can be a prop, ESC, or motor that doesn’t behave like the rest. But I find that’s less common than the above."

99,Temporary lost of balance,1,"Hi, I am running mainly mapping missions with a quad Easy Drone XLPro 3.3.3 Arducopter on a Pixhawk. Yesterday and today, it happened that the quad lost its equilibrium twice, yesterday just on top of me before landing, and today in the middle of a straight line. So today it is not due to a brutal transition in trajectory, like I thought yesterday. My first impression today was a quick lost of power. The XLPro have a contact system between arms and avionics which not give me 100% confidence. I think it may becoming loose with time.   But I am unable by looking in the log to be sure of my impression. This is what happened : Attitude  *  Power (indicative, the measurement is at the lipo level, and can not reflect if a motor loose power, here we see probable peak when motor accelerate to recover level) *  There is a lost of radio just before, but I am on “continue if auto mode”, and the lost occured much before *  This is the location where it occurs, and a nadir picture (supposed to be nadir !)

After you reproduced issue and it got captured in log file? After you removed sd card from pixhawk? In case you have solid red LED check pls if you forgot to insert sd card back to pixhawk? So far I can see in your log file it seems you have problem with pixhawk powering from power module. It should has Vcc voltage value from 5.0V to 5.2V. As you can see your actual Vcc is about 4.7V which is not enough: What kind of power module you are using? You need to measure a voltage on Vcc line  from power module to pixhawk by multimeter. It should be about 5.3V. Here is pixhawk power connector pinout:

Basically all electronics are same from another frame that was disassembled except the frame and its landing gear. this is the 4 test flight, and was planned to check landing gear and move on to AutoTune… When pushed button to retract landing gear, the copter yawed left and started to move FWD like it was commanded to fly straight. copter was uncontrollable, did not respond to anything so i pulled kill switch (i assume this is what stopped it) Broke a motor clamp and one of the leg T joints. E.g, i did used landing gear on ground during build but not in flight. Attached is log file, hoping someone can help in analysis. * (3.4 MB)",
103,Unable to control yaw in CIRCLE mode,1,"As the title suggests, I was unable to control the copter’s yaw while in CIRCLE mode, when the * clearly states that I should be able to.

If it helps, I triggered the CIRCLE mode by using a LOITER_TURNS waypoint, which the drone executed succesfully (apart from not letting me take control of yaw). I am running Copter 3.3.3 Thanks in advance",If by “I triggered the CIRCLE mode by using a LOITER_TURNS waypoint” you mean that you were in Auto mode then it is normal you couldn’t control yaw - that has never been possible although from a comment in code it looks like the intention was to allow it.

What I did was load a mission containing a LOITER_TURNS waypoint, load it to the aircraft and set it to auto mode. It took off (first waypoint), then went for the LOITER_TURNS and finally landed all on its own. From what you’ve said it seems like there should be a different way to make it enter CIRCLE mode. I am using Mission Planner and I’ve just noticed that in the Actions tab you can choose the Circle Mode and then use Set Mode. Is that what you mean? Where would the drone make the circle in this situation? I know the radius and set are defined as parameters."

You sent me an email saying “I have a problem with Pixhawk V 3.3. The copter stopped motors while flying and the log says crash check 1. I am very worried about this. In the forum at ardupilot I am not getting a single answer how this could happen.” I have now looked over your logs as you requested and once you sent me the links to where you posted questions I can see you have been given answers, instructions how to fix it and even a way to ignore it. The cause, quoting  Andre K, “It was unable to get desired attitude for several seconds, trigging a crash-check (crash was detected due to the fact that it did not get near desired attitude - so it disarmed)” And Randy, “So what you’re hitting is the crash check. There’s a wiki page about it here which describes when it can trigger: *” And the cause of the problem from Randy “In general it means the vehicle is quite out of control. It can happen with a very bad tune but it needs to be really quite bad.” Also implying the obvious fix of tuning the copter properly. And the way of ignoring the cause and fixing the problem you noticed, again from Randy: “The crash check can be disabled but it’s probably best to get to the root of the control problems.” The first thing I noticed about your copter was that it was obviously not properly tuned. I can also see that the outputs of each axis is not balanced (Rate log) meaning you have some combination of rotated arms, offset CG, or uncalibrated ESC’s. I can clearly see your copter is only just able to fly. It may look like it is hovering ok to you but the logs clearly show that it could fall out of the sky at any time. The magnitude of the roll and yaw errors are far beyond anything I would consider reasonable. I would suggest you take some time to tune your aircraft. I would also suggest you read up on and use Autotune. If you can’t do an autotune without suffering an esc failure then your aircraft is not airworthy. If you don’t wish to use autotune I would suggest setting these parameters after you have finished your manual tune. These are conservative parameters that will minimise the risk of a poorly tuned copter going bad.

107,Power drop in one of the motors at full/big throttle,1,"Hi, My tricopter (based on pixhawk) has an issue when a rear motor is not catching up with front two motors during max/big throttle in stabilize mode. It results in a pitch backwards initially and after a moment pitch corrects itself. This issue isn’t noticeable in loiter and alt hold (probably due to smaller accelerations), but and it seems to behave normally during rapid pitching and rolling in those 2 modes. Things that i’ve tried and that are not a cause of the problem: -Motors and controllers itself are working properly, timing is fine, no soldering issues. -Battery seems to supply power normally as well. -I’ve changed power wiring to rear for a thicker one. Judging from logs, it seems that ardupilot is sending correct signals and it is actually increasing motor speed signal when detecting rotation. Have anyone dealt with similar issue or does anyone have any ideas on what might be a problem here? Thank you for any help.","Andrew, Have you gone through the autotune procedure? If it works fine in loiter, it’s possible the PIDs for stabilize mode aren’t set properly. I just tune up a new copter in 3.4 and it worked great. Dave"

You need to make absolutely sure you do the following with that frame:  Level the motor mounts Check that the COG is about centered with where the FC is. Balance the props (especially if using CF props, but they should be balanced regardless)  Also, make sure you have the correct firmware loaded (Hexa X for the 680) and make sure you are plugged in to the right motors and they spin the correct directions. EDIT:  just noticed you said you affixed the Pixhawk via velcro?  Probably not a good idea as vibrations will cause issues in altitude and GPS modes.

I made an ugly transport case from foam, I am not worried anymore about transportation, if someone is interested I will post some pics. "
110,Pixhawk acting weird yaws after take off then changes pitch and roll directions,10,"Hey guys, A noob over here  I have been flying with a friend’s quad with pixhawk couple of times and loved it. Been on the search for a pixhawk rotorcraft and finally found a good hexa (tarot 680) and bought it. Unfortunately I cannot get it to fly good, had couple of small flights with bad props and thought that some problems are coming from there, because of the vibration, but yeasterday I flew with t-motor props and the problem persisted. I have checked the booms, everything is tight, the pixhawk is attached by velcro. What would be causing this problem? What should I check/do? Thanks in advance! Nick",Moved to Copter
111,Drone tilts forward during takeoff,1,"I’m still working out some PID issues on my drone.  I think I’m going to risk it and use autotune even though the motors are around 400kv.

Once in the air it levels out and starts acting like I would expect it to (minus the stability issues with the PIDs).

With slow motors it takes longer for it to correct and will lead to poor position hold.  By the time the flight controller corrects it already has moved too far leading to over correction.  PID toning would help. Mike

The RTL was going fine until it suddenly stopped sending telemetry packets for 2 seconds. The radios were still communicating, but no data was coming through from the pixhawk for a couple of seconds at the crucial time. That is unlikely to be coincidence. I can’t even tell for certain if the vehicle disarmed as it doesn’t send any more HEARTBEAT packets. It does send a few other packets (such as one GLOBAL_POSITION_INT which shows the altitude). It also sent one VFR_HUD packet showing throttle at zero, which probably means it did disarm, but that is not certain. Note that disarming should not stop it sending telemetry. Without the DF log I can’t tell for sure if this was a hardware or software failure. I know that doesn’t help you. I can tell you that it didn’t reboot as the timestamps didn’t reset. Sorry I can’t be more helpful!"

116,Sloppy altitude control in loiter,1,"Hi all, this is a problem I have seen with both of my pixhawk-equipped drones: During loiter if I do some maneuvring (semi-aggressive yaw while forward flight or something) my quad will lose atitude to the point that I have to give aggressive throttle up in order to save it from touching the ground. It doesn’t seem like altitude control is as locked-in as I’d like. From what I can understand the idea is that the unit should attempt to keep current altitude as long as the throttle stick is centered or within the deadband range around center when in loiter. I find that when testing this by flying 3-4 meters above ground it will loose too much altitude and get dangerously close to ground. I have more than enough power in my unit (hovers at about 40% stick), I just get the impression that arducopter prioritizes control input in the horizontal plane more than in the vertical plane. IMHO it should be the opposite, avoiding hitting ground should be more important than reacting to horizontal movements. In any case my unit has more than enough power for both. Is there anything I can tune to make my unit keep its altitude more precisely? What alt range should I expect from my unit? Comparing with my old phantom 2 that unit is able to hold altitude extremely well… Any pointers appreciated!",Don’t know what your copter looks like which effects how it flies.  Altitude will drift by 10 or 15 meters based on conditions.  Since altitude is controlled by air pressure if you fly in one direction the copter may build up air pressure and cause it to rise or if its on the back side may cause a vacuum and it will fall.  If the copter is fully enclosed like the Phantom it should not have this problem.

I’m within that I guess, but it still seems a lot. Does this mean that ArduCopter will give more weight to the pressure sensor than the GPS? Since Loitering already requires a GPS and I never Loiter without a HDOP above 1,5 (not sure about my VDOP) I would assume that GPS is more precise than the pressure sensor, except for when the craft does micro-adjustments. I’m currently running a Quanum XJ470, the Pixhawk unit is pretty open and would probably be subject to wind."

So I tested again just now, and you are correct, it does indeed correct itself. Funny thing is: If I do some semi-agressive maneuvring it loses height. When I let go of the sticks it will slowly ascend a little bit, so its like it is aware of the fact that it is losing a little bit of height, but it prioritizes right-stick/yaw behavior over throttle. As long as I have more than enough power in reserve, why doesn’t it just keep the desired altitude at all times instead of allowing itself to lose alt and then compensate after I’ve stopped? Maybe I’m too picky here, maybe the pressure change after stopping causes it to realize its too low. I haven’t looked at the logs yet."

The copter is doing what you ask and does not hold altitude but do what you want and fly faster.  You can adjust the lean angle to not allow it to lean as far which will also reduce the forward speed but will help to keep altitude.

I have more than enough power in my unit (hovers at about 40% stick), I just get the impression that arducopter prioritizes control input in the horizontal plane more than in the vertical plane. IMHO it should be the opposite, avoiding hitting ground should be more important than reacting to horizontal movements. In any case my unit has more than enough power for both. Is there anything I can tune to make my unit keep its altitude more precisely? What alt range should I expect from my unit? Comparing with my old phantom 2 that unit is able to hold altitude extremely well… Any pointers appreciated!","I’ve been reading up a bit, and for me I got good results from changing the EKF_ALT_NOISE parameter to 7, giving less weight to the pressure sensor and more to the GPS. I’m running a good GPS on this unit (ublox m8n), and also reduced the  GPS_HDOP_GOOD value somewhat to make sure I have a good quality GPS lock before I can use any flight mode requiring the GPS. The first tests were promising, I can’t see any altitude loss when maneuvring in loiter mode now. Will continue testing tomorrow."

Unsure, but it might have relation to poor-leveled controller dampening/mount. Also, I believe you need to perform accelerometers calibration once more and to pay especial attention to drone leveling at position “level”. IMHO it is most important position for calibration procedure. p.s. it is good practice while taking off is to take it quickly to altitude about 1.0-1,5 meters and then hover it. This way your drone could avoid turbulence from his own airflows reflected from the ground. regards, Dmitry"

Now, if I increase the max gain limits on the PID, will the autotune limits also be increased, or will I also need to change something in control_autotune.cpp as well? Also, not too sure how to increase the max gain, but wondering if the limits for PID gains (through the GUI) are the same as limits on the autotune."

129,STorM32 controller and Pixhawk,1,"I’ve been through the wiki for the STorM32 gimbal controller and the Pixhawk wiki too, but nowhere is there any information relating to the advantages of controlling the gimbal through the FC. I have mine hooked up directly to the X8R which seems to work fine, although I guess a splitter on the S-Bus would be more elegant. What I would dearly like to know is how to get the Gimbal to follow a point of interest, controlled by the FC. Would this entail using Telem2 on the PX4, and setting the Gimbal to emit a Mavlink heatrbeat etc.? Can someone please steer me in the right direction please…? Best DP.","both configurations have their advantages and disadvantages connecting the STorM32 directly to the receiver (either via PWM, PPM, or sbus splitter) has the advantage that one can use all functions of the STorM32 via the transmitter, but the disadvantage that obviously none of the features where the FC needs to control the gimbal are possible vice versa, connecting the STorM32 to the Pixhawk (either by using PWM outputs from the Pixhawk or a serial connection) has the advantage that those features where the FC controls the gimbal are possible, but the disadvantage that essentially none of the STorM32’s functions can be accessed via a transmitter. As a corollary it follows: For follow me you either can chose to use Pixhawk’s PWM outputs connected to STorM32’s RC inputs, or use a serial connection. In the latter case, you have two options, either to use the Mavlink protocol on the serial connection or the STorM32 serial protocol, as it’s called in the docu. So, you have 3 options to achieve one and the same. I’m not aware of a significant advantage/disadvantage of either of them. As a 2nd corollary, in order to get the “best of both sides” you could have “wires” from both the receiver and the Pixhawk to the StorM32, for instance a sbus splitter from the receiver to the STorM32 and a serial connection from the Pixhawk to the STorM32. Alternatively, in case of a (quad) copter and a NT STorM32 setup you could consider using betacopter, which gives you the best of both with only a serial connection from the Pixhawk to the StorM32. Plenty of possibilities. Hope that clarifies things a bit."

It is a developer kit which is not completely unlike optical flow. It just a sensor array of visual and ultrasonic sensors which can be used for collision avoidance purposes. It works in five directions (forward, back, left, right, and down). As it simply provides sensory information, it is the flight controller itself which would need to make use of the data. Again, this is a developer kit. As the manual indicates that the sensors can be used with other ‘intelligent systems’, I just wanted to see if anyone knew whether or not the sensor information could be used with any of the open source solutions. These sensors provide velocity data, obstacle distance data, IMU data, ultrasonic data, grey-scale image, and depth image. It really isn’t like changing the engine of a car. It’s just adding some sensors. Like I said, the closest comparison would be optical flow, but I don’t see anyone’s arms up in the air about optical flow.

I’ve tried loading the default parameters but have had no success. Additional symptoms: I’ve got quite high numbers for my external compass offset which I can’t seem to lower no matter how far I move it. On the ground in stabilise mode, the pixhawk is able to get a good GPS lock and blinks green. The second I move over to any GPS mode however, it loses GPS lock and begins to blink blue!! I should mention that the GPS module looks a bit rubbish (it hasn’t got any external markings at all) and some of the wires came out on the first day. I glued them back in and my first few flights went beautifully though! I have had no crashes or even moved my quad since last weekend but I feel like the GPS module could be the source of all my problems. Any thoughts?"

137,Loiter mode Oscillation in Pitch axis,1,"I have non standard copter frame. It is 280 sized X8 with DYS 1806 and 5x3 props. I call it Beast X8  After autotune it is flying very well in Stabilize and reasonable well in Loiter/Poshold. Only what I had to do is lowering “D” to remove fast oscilations during start procedure (before lift off, guess that it is based on ground effect) But in loiter I am getting kind of strange behavior. During fast stop or in reaction on wind gust copter starts oscillate on pitch axis. Copter is siting almost on one place and moving nose up and down. *  - It is visible here (about in middle). edit : during last session I seen even bigger amplitudes as during this video I always hit stick soon when it started to get rid of it. Log from last tuning session is here - * . It was long session with this progress >  decreased D to remove ground oscillations decreased various parameters including pos hold break angle and loiter PI  result is questionable - now I getting less problems during flight because copter is breaking more lazy. So there is less fast stops and so also less oscillations. But it is still there - for example as reaction on wind gust. Also what maybe can help - if I fly in loiter, copter don’t set angle and fly but increase angle, then decreasing it and increasing again and so… again I think that it is only in pitch axis. Similar oscilations but with lower amplitude and stretched into line. Rest is ok (by my opinion)  vibrations are low , pix is mounted on omnimac mount compasses should be ok enough sats (BN-880) board is Pixhawk Lite (no space to normal size) Taranis E transmitter 5800 3S lipol brand new Carbon filled nylon props used during last test CG was close to copter center (but probably not 100%) slightly decreased Throttle params (recommended by someone as way from extremely low PID’s on those small configs) alt hold is on 50% of throttle  Can somebody look on log and tell me what to set or what to fix ?","So I fixed it. I noticed that there is fast oscillations in roll axis and slow in pitch. Resolution was easy - set independent PID’s and decrease D for roll and increase D and decrease P for pitch. And done, it flies much much better (although some fine tuning will be needed)"

141,High Internal Compass offsets,1,"Hi All, I am after some help with a compass issue.

After doing this a few times the offsets are now coming up green more often than not when the calibration is performed. Not say it is fixed, but it certainly showed a change, On a side note, I now have 3.4rc5 install with the latest version of MP installed and the compass calibrates after only doing 2 axis. Will change back to 3.3 and see what happens."

143,Gyro calibration corrupted by gimbal initialization,1,"There is something I always hated with APM / Pixhawk : it is the initialization of the gimbal . The fact that no valid PWM (I guess) is outputed by the Pixhawk after the battery connection leads to uncontrolled movements of camera gimbal with the risk to damage the camera lens.

With a brushless gimbal and a heavy camera (1kg),  the gyro calibration , blue - red led , is corrupted by the gimbal movement when it gets a valid PWM signal. Is  there a way to control when  gyro calibration occurs , initialize the PWM outputs with a delay or launch a new gyro calibration via Mission Planner ?","The best way to sort the issues you have is to delay the powering on of the gimbal. I do it in a very basic way, just placed a switch on the power line of the gimbal."

Using a micro the supply voltage to the gimbal is delayed by a certain time allowing Pixhawk to perform gyro calibration without movements from the gimbal and given to the gimbal a valid PWM when the gimbal complete his calibration. I decide for 15 seconds delay but I could choose obviously any other delay. Guess that with a resistor and a capacitor a delay in powering up the gimbal could be achieved but the micro is more flexible even if using a 5$ micro for that is a waste.

I’ve received the Pixhawk with the AC3.2.1 preloaded and it worked fine until yesterday, when the quad haven’t remained level during take off. I had a hard landing last week, if you can call that, and rebuilt the landing gear of my frame. Updated to AC3.3.3 and whenever I tried to spin motors or calibrate the Accel, MP was constantly saying “Initialising APM…”. Went back to AC3.2.1 now and calibrated the Accel without problems, working on calibrating the rest. Any idea what the “Initialising APM…” message means?",
146,PID clarification for new setup,1,"Hello, just a stupid question. I’ve a new setup with Tarot 650sport with 17 propellers and Turnigy 4112 320kv motors, pixhawk FC, 6S.

Basic and advanced PID tuning explained in the docs, influence also the loiter mode or are just related to non GPS mode? The reason of my question is  that there are also specific tuning fo loiter only and I don’t know if I need to focus on these parameter only. Thanks for the help","The Rate and Stabilize loops are active any time you are in modes that are not acro.  In acro, just the Rate loop is used.  There are a couple of loiter tuning parameters but for most copters they work OK.  Tune your copter first then see how the loiter performance is.  I recommend running an autotune, it should work very well on that frame and power train setup."

Just for info, after some additional flight, reduction of the Throttle out parameter was required (about 300 instead of 500) to reach the stick mid position. Same story for the Roll and Rate PID (current value 0.1). Currently the most important issue to solve is that, in loiter and Alt-Hold, when the copter brake, it’s not able to remain at the same altitude. It loose about 1 or 2 meters. When it’s back in hovering, it regain the correct position. In hovering the hold of altitude is correct. Do you have an idea where the issue can be? Thanks again."

The key search is air bubble effect on the barometer and can be minimized/eliminated with a good isolation of the barometer chip on the flight controller.

147,Gps 3D fix but blue led,1,"Hi all, I’m facing a real strange problem. After three hours of regular flights in the past week today after powering up the copter and his Pixhawk clone with  Drotek Ublox 8 gps the rgb led turn to steady blue (I disabled the arming button) .

On the map the copter position changed a little within a two or three meters in ten minutes, Only once i got an error msg about gps horizontal velocity but I thought it was related to a bad gyro calibration . I tried everything , several reboots , disable Geofence that was the only change I did but it did not help.","Solved ! The weird thing of the blue led status was that it let me arm the motors while in Loiter mode.

148,Couple questions about controlling a gimbal in missions,1,"I’ve been getting some videos, and have come up with a couple of questions I can’t find the answers to. One is, how do I tell the copter to point the nose of the copter towards the ROI, vs pointing just the gimbal at the ROI?  I thought I read in the past that there was a setting to control that, whether you have retractable landing gear, etc. And second is, can we control the gimbal speed, when acquiring a new target?  As it is, it is moving too quickly when it points to a new ROI, so the video jumps to the new target, rather than smoothly moving there.    Would that be a copter setting, or should I look at my gimbal config for that? If it’s not a copter setting, would it be possible at some point in the future?  I could see a use in having some slow pans, and then programming some faster ones later in a scene.

The red message “Error compass variance” is rapidly switching back and forth inbetween “Error compass variance” and “Bad AHRS”. [attachment=0]error.jpg[/attachment] This is a completly new behaviour and just happend “overnight”. I didn’t change anything here except I unplugged the external compass. At least now I know why the EKF failsafe is triggering in-flight, however I have absolutely no idea where that problem is coming from and how to fix this. Just to remind everybody: The screenshot was taken right after flashing, without anything being configured. I have neither attached a GPS nor an external compass right now. After recalibrating the internal compass and rebooting the Pixhawk, the EKF compass status often stays below 0,5 and the “Error compass variance” message is gone. However after moving the copter, the status often goes over 0,8, triggering the EKF failsafe (as seen in the screenshot). What can I do here? Do I need an external compass? Is something defective?

It looks like it’s a 4S battery and after nearly 20min it’s fallen from 17-ish volts to about 14.5V.  Right at the end you can see the total requested throttle sent to the motors goes to 100%.  The individual outputs to the motors hit their upper limits as well so the vehicle loses yaw control. I think the best solution is to increase the FS_BATT_VOLTAGE (i.e. battery failsafe voltage) from 13.9V to perhaps 14.5V).

The symptoms  that something is going bad soon is the heading that change of some degrees or start to go in one direction. In dataflash log just before minute 9 you can see a variation in both MAG.MagX andxMAG2.MagX. That time it start rotated on yaw but it stop or I control it with Yaw stick, do not remember. It happened again before uncontrolled descent/crash at minute 19. It start to yaw right for some 150°, I switched to stabilized mode trying to keep the copter up giving more throttle and yaw command bur the hexa do not responds to radio sticks and gently went down in stable attitude , almost as if it was landing automatically but with no control  from radio and a little bit fast. No damages , or crash event on Mission Planner . No error messages, no warnings , no EKF compass errors, Esc or motors were not hot at all. Almost no vibrations at all. Batteries when copter decided to “land” were at 14.6 Volts , the day after I did a test on a twin copter with different Esc and Ubecs that powered the Pixhawk and was able to fly 10 more minutes after minute 19 of crash. So batteries are not the problem , when I charged them , they show the same amount of mAh drawn. Looking at dataflash log what is really without explanation to me is :  Desired Altitude change by itself while I was in Loiter mode  ! Pixhawk received the Throttle command but rose only apparently two motors while the other 4 were reduced. Even if I was in Stabilize mode I do not have anymore the control even if the receiver got sticks commands.  Yaw rotation in coincidence  with Mag error , a cause or a consequence ? *","Hi Randy, thanks for the reply. the copter with the same battery pack (two new high quality (250USD both ) 12900mAh 25C  4S) once the YAW Pids were set by Autotune flew in exactly the same conditions 10 minutes more, till 13,7 volts when failsafe engage without any issue.Not one but several times. A depleted battery at 100% motors request , 33A in this case, at the voltage of 14,5 Volts would have fall in voltage a lot, at the contrary, you do not see any voltage difference . It is like if the radio sticks were ignored. There is another   strange aspect , the DesAlt change while in Loiter and after in AltHold but if you take a look at RcIn3, throttle , it did not chage . So what change Des ALt ? Yesterday I got again strange problems , It happended after I save and load configuration file. Sudden Yaw changes without any input from radio stick, a arming switch alert while the arming switch was disable (checked twice reading again all parameter list) . The Yaw changes were sudden and happens almost immediately in stabilize mode, after a new radio calibration the problem seems to have disappear. I will post the .bin file . Is it possible that where parameters are written , internal 2mb memory I guess, is corrupt ? Is there a way to check it ?"

I am running arducopter 3.3.3 on my DJI F550 hexacopter. When i try to calibrate my compasses, my compas#1 looks okay. But my compas#2 doen’t look that okay. The compas#2 is the internal compas, as i have tried disconnecting the external, and then the problem become compas#1… When i calibrate the compasses the compas#2 is completely away from the view. Totally in the background. Not around the x,y,z axis as compas#1… My board is a HKPilot32 from hobbyking. I think it is a okay board, and i don’t hope my board is broken. I have tried attaching pictures of my calibration view, and my drone, if there should be any interferrence. When i fly, it flies relatively stable? Looking at the map, it is not fixed in the compas. It drifts a bit, like 1 or 2 degress forth and back within a couple of minutes… Is this okay? It also returns to launch quite precise. But the view in mission planner doesn’t look like the things on youtube and other tutorials. I know the pictures show i am at home, but the error is there on the field too.

However, not matter what I do I seem to get the same error over and over. Now, either I am doing something really stupid or I have a broken apm/gps(with compass). I wish its a quick fix and its a stupid mistake on my part but also am aware that after mexico stopped producing these boards and the apm 2.8’s are mainly exported from SZ, it also could just be broken.

When I wanted to make it fly, I noticed that a feet of the drone wanted to take off before the other one (So one side of the drone has more thrust). I continued to have a full take off, but the drone doesn’t take off vertically… I had to let it crash as soft as possible 30 meters further away ! Back at home, I tested the rotation speed of each motor with propellers in ESC calibration mode (I bought a turnigy tachometer). All propellers are turning well at the same speed for the same throttle level ! So I think my motors are OK, and my ESC are well calibrated. Other test : Drone attached to the ground, with propellers mounted, I armed my drone. The propellers started to spin slowly (normal, and all at the same speed). I increased just a little the throttle, and the propellers are turning faster, but strangly, some propellers are turning faster and faster (without any other throttle increase), and some other are slowing down. I did a quick measure : the slower propeller was at 800RPM when the fastest was at 2700RPM. Can anyone try to explain me what is wrong ? What should I try, or change ? Can it be because of vibrations ? Thank you for your help !","Here is a link to the log pages in the manual * Have a read through the other relevant pages as well. Nearly everything you need to know is in there. To be able to determine what is happening in the flight controller the logs will be needed. Are all the motors straight?

It sounds like you do not have much RC experience, so downloading a simulator and using it with your Transmitter to get your thumbs trained would be a big help to you."

This system has a custom build linux ubilinux install and runs ROS Indigo and mavros. So far I have modified some of the mavros files to include the conventional helicopter frame type and the system functions well. What I would like to know is, am I able to use the guided mode to set a position using say setpoint on mavlink and still use the onboard attitude control? Additionally, at the present I still have the GPS fitted however I have disabled this since I fly indoors and have vicon position data sent to my drone in the NED frame. Ultimately what I would like to achieve is to be able to control both position and velocity through the guided mode to conduct some ground effect experiments.

One thing I know is that I cranked up the throttle to the max once I noticed the quad started rapidly losing altitude… I’m guessing no matter mode I was in, that should have made it go up. My theory is that this was battery related as Mike first suggested.  I think I made a big newb mistake ignoring the C rating of my battery.  The 5200mah 10c battery can only deliver a continuous current of 52 amps.  The max continuous current drawn by my motors is 17 amps x 4 = 68 amps ( plus ~ 1 amp for the other electronics).  It looks like it’s definitely possible to go over, as I did go full speed at one point on the lake. Does this seem like the likely cause?  Does the behavior in the video match what would have likely occurred if I exceeded the battery’s maximum output?  Any other things you guys can suggest I can do to help analysis like this in the future (enable logging of given things?  any hardware I could install?)."
175,"Unable to switch to POS_HOLD mode with error ""Err: FLIGHT_MODE-16""",0,"I have had this problem 2 times and it has always been a mystery for me.  I have attached a log of the flight. As you can see when I try to change the flight mode to POS_HOLD, it still remains in STABLE mode and the error is reported in the log. Looking at the code I can see that the mode switch will not happen if the call to position_ok() fails. However as you can see in the log, there are enough satellites available. The EKF log shows PE, PN and PD is ok indicating that the position is known by the system. I was hoping someone can decipher this and then we can figure out how to avoid this. I have attached the log. This particular log is for heli but I think that it does not matter because the issue is because of EKF which is code shared by all Copter code. I searched this forum to see if someone else had this issue. I did find a post, but in that case there was no GPS lock, so it is a totally different matter. * (575.2 KB)",

177,Hex Crash with 3.3.3 Odd motor shutdown logic,1,"Hello Working on discovering why one of our hexcopters dropped out the sky from 30m (not too much damage  )    Was basically in Alt Hold mode, with gentle moving around, in fairly windy conditions.  Without warning, all motors stopped and the Taranis reported ‘crash’ even before it hit the ground. Note: This Hex had been flown the previous day, with no problems at all for over 45 mins including gentle and aggressive flight inputs, so clearly no issues at that point. So, looking at the Pixhawk bin/log, we see that the barometer reading was reading approx 30m then no further records except for Crash entry Reading the docs, this looks like a brown out.  We’ll address that (if that is the case) with a backup BEC to the servo 5v rail. However, the interesting thing is this:  To test the brown out theory, we took the props off, added a good 5v supply from a bench power supply to servo rail then tested with various throttle settings and rolling the copter around by hand.   We replicated the motor shutdown on each test (we were in stabalised mode and armed the motors from transmitter with Pixhawk light going from flashing blue to blue on motor arm) To take out the existing BEC supply/brown out issues, we disconnected the ESCs and all other non essentially connectors from the Pixhawk (GPS, Telemetry etc) and ran the tests again just from the bench 5v supply.  Same problem. With a bit of refinement, we discovered that motors always turned off when the pitch or roll was +/- 30 degrees for a second or so.  We tested another drone (quad, with Pixhawk running 3.3.3) and same thing happened. Further investigation showed that if we applied say back elevator on the Taranis, we could go past 30 degrees no problem, presumably because the Pixhawk is expecting that nose up command. So my guess is it looks like that when the Pixhawk detected un-commanded pitch or roll past 30 degrees, it assumes that the copter is not responding by way of thrust in the opposite direction and perhaps assuming a failed motor or prop off situation, then shuts down into crash mode. Could someone please verify this is expected behaviour - if so, I’m wondering if the hex crashed because of a strong gust pushing the roll briefly past the 30 degree point.  Shutting down the motors at this point seems a bit drastic if that is by design. Hopefully we’ve just missed something simple. Many thanks Gary","OK, looks like I jumped the gun here.

187,Roll and pitch oscillations then crash,1,"Hi all, Yesterday I went to the field to do my 1st flight and autotune the PID gains of a custom frame quadcopter. The configuration is ‘X’ and I use Pixhawk with APM Copter V3.3.3. 30A ESCs with D3530/14 motors, 7x4’’ 3 bladed props and a 4S 5000mA LiPo battery. I attach a photo of the copter. I did all the needed calibrations and checks through the Mission Planner 1.3.39. The GPS signal was strong outside and after a preflight test I took off the copter in stabilize mode around 1 meter from the ground and I moved it around some meters with my Taranis telemetry system. The flight for some secdonds was smooth enough but suddently the copter started to oscillate around the roll axis without being able to stabilize until it hit the ground. This happened before turn to Alt hold mode and switch the pre-configured channel 7 for the autotuning of the PIDs. I went through the log file and in ATT signals I see the desired roll and pitch to be almost zero but the response from the pixhawk is violent oscillations. I can not see any hardware error prior or during the oscilations. I believe that the PID default values probably made the response unstable.

We can see from the start that motors 3 and 4 are running higher than 1 and 2 indicating it’s fighting a yaw since these motor are on opposite sides spinning in the same direction.  Later we see the yaw get worse as motors 1 and 2 start to oscillate back and forth trying to get the copter to yaw back or something. Can’t tell if there was magnetic interference or the copter was moving around but both compass were recording the same event. Need to find out why the copter is fighting a yaw in the first place.

187,Roll and pitch oscillations then crash,2,"Hi all, Yesterday I went to the field to do my 1st flight and autotune the PID gains of a custom frame quadcopter. The configuration is ‘X’ and I use Pixhawk with APM Copter V3.3.3. 30A ESCs with D3530/14 motors, 7x4’’ 3 bladed props and a 4S 5000mA LiPo battery. I attach a photo of the copter. I did all the needed calibrations and checks through the Mission Planner 1.3.39. The GPS signal was strong outside and after a preflight test I took off the copter in stabilize mode around 1 meter from the ground and I moved it around some meters with my Taranis telemetry system. The flight for some secdonds was smooth enough but suddently the copter started to oscillate around the roll axis without being able to stabilize until it hit the ground. This happened before turn to Alt hold mode and switch the pre-configured channel 7 for the autotuning of the PIDs. I went through the log file and in ATT signals I see the desired roll and pitch to be almost zero but the response from the pixhawk is violent oscillations. I can not see any hardware error prior or during the oscilations. I believe that the PID default values probably made the response unstable.

My first thought was maybe you got a prop slipping, or a faulty motor or ESC. My second thought, looking at the photo, is that you are only using two of the four motor mounts.  How much frame flex are you getting on liftoff?  If the arms start to twist and develop torsional oscillation under dynamic load the 'copter will become uncontrollable."

Regarding the compasses, I have deactivated the internal one because during some tests in the ground I had seen a lot of interference from the current. During this sort flight the copter was not really changing its heading as far as I remember. Is it normal that the motors 3 and 4 run a bit higher or not? I checked the props after the crash and are still tight. Also te motors seem to rotate without any strange behaviour. The arms are from carbon fiber 10x10x1mm and are quite stiff. I tested by trying to twist the arms from 2 opposite motors and you feel the frame very rigid. In the middle I have 2 carbon fiber plates of 2mm thickness that are connected with the rods. (The holes have been made with cnc mill so all the ‘distances’ are the same, the frame is ‘symmetric and balanced’)  I use all the motor mounts. Just in one motor I have cut previously one ‘leg’ but I use anyway 2 screws on each motor mount (see attached photo). I have also added small pieces of rubber (from the inner tube of a bike) between the aluminium motor mounts and the carbon rod in order to reduce the vibrations. What do you suggest to check in order to issolate and try to find the cause. I am thinking to reduce the PID gains first and try to fly again in stabilize mode. Also to repeat all the calibrations (gyro, accelerometers and compass) and ESCs. Can you maybe suggest me how much to decrease? the gains of the PIDs. Thanks in advance."

While it may seem “stiff” in a static situation on the bench, what you get dynamically when it’s flying is usually different.  If the motors are not staying in their static alignment once the aircraft is airborne, it will cause undesirable flight characteristics.  So I would keep that in mind if nothing else works. You are using Pixhawk, and I am using APM2.8 clone board with AC3.2.1.  So this may have changed in the mean time, but the default PID’s for Stabilize were 4.5 in AC3.2.1.  If that is still the case in AC3.3 with Pixhawk, I guess I would try lowering them to like 3.0.  Take off and fly at about a meter over a software surface like grass or something and see what it does. But like Mike said, you have uneven motor inputs and that needs to be fixed or looked into.  If you tie the 'copter down and run it up all the motors should be running the same speed.  There’s different things that could cause that - one of them being frame flex introducing a yaw in one direction, so two motors are trying to compensate.  Or it could be caused by a faulty ESC or motor, or poor ESC calibration.  Using a strobe tach, or an app in your smart phone to get an idea of the motor speeds with the 'copter tied down at like 50% throttle should indicate whether you have an ESC, calibration or motor problem."

That is because that log starts when I reconnected the GCS to the drone after the second GCS failsafe.

191,Police radio causes fly away?,1,"My quad was flying an autonomous mission flawlessly. I had it doing a set of radius loiters and when complete it was supposed to return to launch. All of the sudden it flies off and ends up 70ft up in a tree. Within a few seconds a police car that was about 200ft away speeds off with blue lights flashing. I ran an analysis on the log and it said that there was a compass failure. The log said there was a sudden change in the magnetic field of 38%. I should have landed the quad before it hit the tree, but I kept thinking that it was going to turn back. Had to call a tree service to get it down. Broke an arm and my camera gimbal, but have repaired everything. Could the police radio have caused the flyaway? Test: Compass = FAIL - Large change in mag_field (37.84%)","I’m doubting the police radio did this. None of this is probably very helpful but - its more of a chunk of thought out of my head.  I’ve helped my brother troubleshoot some compass issues like this…flying in a location that is similar to this. Compass readings are hardly a static thing and based on my personal observations (meaning I’m no authority on the subject by any means), are worse when yaw-ing, or moving laterally which kind of makes sense to me. I’ve seen the readings go straight into the red, I believe even higher than this (like 40% or more)  with no fly away or anything near what’s happening with you in this instance. And it seemed to be a fairly quick anomaly in just about every case. This happen to us when he had a Gopro 3 wifi turned on, which interfered with the RC. But I attributed that to the radio, which was constantly giving us RSSI low warnings - and turned out to have a problem. A new radio solved that one. I’ve had no issues running 2.4ghz right next to my transmitter, in flight (using a pi companion - even though people say it’s a bad idea). I’ve had my pi setup with 2 wifi dongles - one which connected to the gopro wireless on startup, and sent wget control through the pi for camera control. I didn’t have any specific interference or noticeable loss in signal from it. I had an issue like this on mine, when one time my gps mount came loose…the gps fell and was hanging upside down by the cable. We somehow managed to land it but what a journey lol. I don’t see the police vehicle anywhere in the video prior to this happening. I also don’t know of any system or equipment that police use that would interfere with our drones. I wonder if that building across the street might have some type of microwave emissions for radio or even a long range style directional wifi or something that you just happened to cross into the direct path of. It looks like it could be some type of public works facility and that wouldn’t be uncommon in a place like that - the wireless and radio stuff that is. 2.4g devices are friggin everywhere and some of them can quickly overwhelm others. You had just finished a waypoint - it appeared - when this occurred. I’ve been a dodo head before and set my waypoints wrong and had some weirdness like this. Just some thoughts - that sucks when it’s questionable why something like this happens."

So in this case, the MinimOSD is connected but it’s TX line is not connected so it has no way to tell Copter what data it wants and at what speed. The solution is to either connect RX/TX lines from the minimOSD to some free telemetry port on the Pixhawk (or equivalent).  Another option is to set some of the SRX_ parameters (where “X” should be replaced by a number from 0 ~ 3 depending upon which telemetry port is used) to be non-zero so that copter does, by default, send data even if it doesn’t see a request from the GCS/MinimOSD.

This is how I finally got it working for my APM quad- Use a Y cable to connect to both the Minim OSD and Telemetry radio. The OSD RX is from the APM TX splice, also 5v+ and Ground are spliced to corresponding output of APM. That’s it for the connection. The issue I fought was the following:  Battery, voltage, time, altitude, etc. showed “zero” on my heads up display. APM was not sending data to OSD (or telemetry radio for that matter). The artificial horizon WAS WORKING. Connecting APM to my ground station (Mission Planner or Droid Planner) would immediately cause the APM to begin sending data to OSD, and now my heads up display starts showing data normally. Disconnecting the ground station, the OSD continues to function normally. The problem with this is I don’t want to connect then disconnect my ground station every time I want to fly.  Here is how I got it to work without the need of connecting the ground station:   Set the parameter “TELEM_DELAY” to 10 (delay 10 seconds). This delays communication attempts between the APM and Telem radio. I think what was happening is that the radio was initiating communication with the APM before the APM was ready to receive the request. So the APM never started transmitting the data.   Set parameters per the following:   SERIAL1_BAUD, 57 (telemetry output at 57600) SR1_EXT_STAT, 2 ( 2hz for waypoints, GPS raw, fence data, current waypoint, etc) SR1_EXTRA1, 5 ( 5hz for attitude and simulation state) SR1_EXTRA2, 2 ( 2hz for VFR_Hud data ) SR1_EXTRA3, 3 ( 3hz for AHRS, Hardware Status, Wind ) SR1_POSITION, 2 ( 2hz for location data ) SR1_RAW_SENS, 2 ( 2hz for raw imu sensor data ) SR1_RC_CHAN, 5 ( 5hz for radio input or radio output data ) I also tried to set SR0_xxx, but never got it to stick as others have also discovered. I understand that SR0 is for the USB, and SR1 is for the telemetry port on APM2. I don’t think it is necessary to modify SR0 anyway. The above worked for me, hopefully it works for you if you are having the same problems. 10 seconds after plugging my chopter in, I have all OSD data reporting. By the way, I flashed my minimOSD with MinimOSD-Extra. Good luck jd"

198,Fastest flight mode?,3,"If I wanted to reach maximum speed, which flight mode will that be? Can altitude hold reach  maximum speed?

Stabile mode starts to have already higher functions running but motor speeds are still mainly controlled by the pilot. Learn to fly on stabile mode first fast as if something goes wrong copter levels it self automatically if you let go the sticks. Then later go to acro and release the full beast in you  -J

Most other parameters can be set; even setting another serial port baud rate could be done.  But if you’re trying to set the serial port rate on the port currently in use, it probably will not work. Think of it this way:  you’re sending a command to change the speed of the link you’re connected to, but you don’t actually change the speed of the connection.  So it’s POSSIBLE you are changing the speed, but in order to check that you’ve actually done so, you’ll need to reconnect at the new speed.  If you change speed, it accepts it, but you’re connected at the old speed, it’s likely you won’t get a response."

206,Additional Mavlink output on Serial4 for OSD?,1,"I’m running AC3.3.3 on all of my copters and installed on 2 of them a micro-minimOSD. Since i was loo lacy to build a Y cable for Telemetry TX and OSD i connected the OSD to serial 4 and changed the configuration of serial 4 to baudrate of 57(57600 bd) and the protocol to 1 (GCS Mavlink). Beside this i have 3DR telemetry on Serial 1, FrSky telemetry on Serial 2 working well. The OSD data LED is blinking indicating that data are coming in but the display does not show any valid data. Does this configuration as described above to have additional MavLink output to serial 4 work at all on the AC firmware? Cheers, Gerald","My understanding so far is With the SerialManager it is possible to set any of Serial1-Serial4 to 1 - GCS Mavlink, 3 - Frsky D-PORT, 4 - Frsky S-PORT, 5 - GPS,… Serial5 is currently linked to the NuttXshell console but there is change request * to have Serial5 also be available for MavLink or other communication The limitation is that a maximum of 4 ports can be handled as GCS Mavlink port in parallel. Since Serial 0 (USB port) is set to 1 - GCS Mavlink 3 other ports can be set as maximum. Therefore theoretically it should work to have Telemetry on Serial 1, FrSky S-Port on Serial 2, GPS on Serial 3 and OSD on Serial 4. My port protocal settings are accordingly: Serial 1 - 1, Serial 2 - 4, Serial 3 - 5, Serial 4 - 1 The question now is what is wrong with my set up… further investigation needed."
206,Additional Mavlink output on Serial4 for OSD?,2,"I’m running AC3.3.3 on all of my copters and installed on 2 of them a micro-minimOSD. Since i was loo lacy to build a Y cable for Telemetry TX and OSD i connected the OSD to serial 4 and changed the configuration of serial 4 to baudrate of 57(57600 bd) and the protocol to 1 (GCS Mavlink). Beside this i have 3DR telemetry on Serial 1, FrSky telemetry on Serial 2 working well. The OSD data LED is blinking indicating that data are coming in but the display does not show any valid data. Does this configuration as described above to have additional MavLink output to serial 4 work at all on the AC firmware? Cheers, Gerald","I solved the problem myself after getting a hint on the german *. I swapped the serial port for OSD and FrSky telemetrie on the Pix. My configuration now Serial 1 - 3DR radio telemetry to GC Serial 2 - OSD Serial 3 - GPS Serial 4 - FrSky telemetry This works! cheers, Gerald"
207,Does AUTO mode prioritize horizontal positioning before increasing altitude?,0,"Hey all, In a project i’m involved with, an X-frame octorotor with Copter 3.3 executes a mission containing  Takeoff to 8 meters (Lat = 0, Lon = 0) Loiter at 8 meters for 5 seconds (Lat = 0, Lon = 0)  and while in transition to the 8 meters takeoff altitude, it deviates horizontally (let’s say due to bad positioning info). Additionally, the PID is intentionally set to sluggishly correct for this horizontal deviance. What I observe is that Copter stops increasing its altitude till it corrects horizontally (observable because the PID is sluggish). Is this the intended behavior for Copter 3.3? If so, can anyone point me in the right place in the Copter code to prioritize altitude gain instead? Thanks!",

My Pixhawk is mounted on the little foam pads that came with it.  My props are balanced and everything on the copter is held on tight.  Maybe also try recalibrating the compass.  You may have something around the compass that’s causing interference also, but I really don’t know that.  Your vibration problems and compass needs to definitely be improved.  Your tuning seems to be reasonable."

Ill try and dig a bit deeper, mainly for my own benefit of learning, into the GPS position, and the commanded pitch and roll Whilst I accept there as a bit of drift, there wasnt a big jump and the copter snap rolled into the ground in under a second with a very rapid roll. Not a general drift into anything. Isnt there a parameter that would limit the pitch/roll angle when in loiter? Thought it was 45 deg. Mine flipped over almost 120deg into the ground.

214,Telem 2 conflict with offboard control,0,"Hi, I’m setting up a pixhawk (genuine 3DR) running Copter 3.3.3 to accept commands from an external Linux computer (Jetson TK1).   The two are currently connected via USB on the TK1 to the USB on the pixhawk.  For a number of reasons, I want to start using the telem2 port, however there seems to be a conflict. If I have the FTDI cable connected when I power the pixhawk the main LED goes solid red after a few seconds, but I can connect to the pixhawk with no warnings or errors. Alternatively, if I plug in the FTDI cable after the pixhawk is all powered up, it stays happy (no red LED), but I can’t connect to it through telem2. According to the documentation I could find, the only settings that appear to need changing are the Serial 2 Protocol (set to 1 for Mavlink), Serial 2 baudrate (set to 115), and serial 2 RTSCTS (set to auto).  I am using this * and wired according to * (hardware setup at the bottom–it’s a PX4 page, but the cable wiring seems to be correct and what I want). Is there another setting?  I’ve tried searching to see if there is something else that uses serial port 2, but haven’t turned up anything.  Any other ideas on how to troubleshoot this? Thanks",
215,Problems with Idle throttle (Copter 3.3.3),1,"Hi all, Hopefully someone can help me with this: I don’t know if my ESCs are super-sensitive or what but here goes: When I arm my quad using the default settings, all 4 motors will start at a fairly high RPM (almost enough to lift off). There is no “gap” between too much power and zero power (I had to “jump-land” my quad when testing this the first time, not a fun experience with a shiny new unit  ). I can see that if I set MOT_SPIN_ARMED to anything below 70, the motors won’t engage in idle, so I’ve left them there - I don’t mind a slow spin just to make sure all 4 motors engage at the same time. However, playing with the THR_MIN (basically adjusting it down) I notice weird things happening (right now I have THR_MIN set to 75), and the moment I give a little bit of stick, one of the motors will actually STOP while the others rev up. If I continue to give throttle slowly the stopped motor will engage at around 25% throttle. The machine flies great, but there’s definetely something wrong with the throttle config, and today the wind almost bumped it over while I was waiting for the “last” motor to engage. So, all in all: To high THR_MIN and the thing is hard to land, since there’s nothing between idle and hover rpms. Too low THR_MIN and all 4 motors don’t engage at the same time. (btw, this is not an ESC issue. I can see in mission planner that the pixhawk gives different values to the 4 motors, so this is a 100% apm problem as far as I can see)","Also, I notice that giving just barely any throttle at all, my motors are actually increasing in RPM. APM seems to feed them more and more power without me adjusting the throttle stick. Since this is all in Stabilize mode, I guess the unit is trying to correct itself. However, there needs to be a “ramp-up” where the stabilization routines don’t kick in at the very lower end of the throttle (like zero throttle + one “notch”). If I set MOT_SPIN_ARMED so that the motors run slowly, apm will actually stop one or two motors when I give a tiny bit of throttle. As I’m playing more with this, here’s another oddity I can’t make sense of. Leaving MOT_SPIN_ARMED at its default value of 70, I’m playing with THR_MIN. In the motor test window I know that my motors engage at 9% so I figured 90 would be a good value. Arming with THR_MIN at 90 spins the motors, and all 4 motor pwm outs send pwm 1147 to the ESCs. However, if I lower THR_MIN to 75, the ESCs receive pwm 1156. How can a lower THR_MIN result in higher pwm outputs?"

ESC calibration set them so that it knows what the range is for your transmitter.  Typical values will be like 1000 min and 2000 max.  Not all transmitters fit that range. Motors will engage at about 1090 or so and if they are at the low end will cause them to stop or brake and stop.  If your copter is to light and too large a prop is used it can cause premature flight. How did you calibrate the ESC’s for this copter?  All at once or individually using channel 3 on the receiver?

The ESCs are well calibrated as far as I can see. Part of the problem is probably the fact that this is a small-ish copter with large-ish rotors, so it will take off on less throttle than what is usual (it will be weighed down by camera setup later). The main problem here is that THR_MIN turned out to actually increase pwm to the motors if it was set to low, as my previous post described. From there I was able to find the lowest value pwm that pixhawk would send to the motors, which turned out to be at around 85. Lower than that and the pwm would start increasing again (which is something I consider a huge bug). It’s flying well now."

The pixhawk believes you want to take off, so it does that to level out the copter - which is totally understandable. The way I tuned it was:  Figure out what throttle the motors start at. The “motor tester” is really good here. Mine start at 9%. Also make sure that all motors start at the same percentage, if not you need to calibrate your escs. 9% means that THR_MIN should be set to 90% as a starting point. Test it from there, and try reducing it lower. At some point the motors will start spin faster instead of slower as you reduce the value. I ended up at 86 (you can view te ch1-4out values to see the pwm out-value. You want it as low as possible where the motors are still spinning.  After doing this, my copter spins the motors very slowly at arm (this can be tuned with MOT_SPIN_ARMED), and I have a good area of “deadband” before the copter takes off. I have no idea why it is like this, but that’s what I had to do anyways."

215,Problems with Idle throttle (Copter 3.3.3),9,"Hi all, Hopefully someone can help me with this: I don’t know if my ESCs are super-sensitive or what but here goes: When I arm my quad using the default settings, all 4 motors will start at a fairly high RPM (almost enough to lift off). There is no “gap” between too much power and zero power (I had to “jump-land” my quad when testing this the first time, not a fun experience with a shiny new unit  ). I can see that if I set MOT_SPIN_ARMED to anything below 70, the motors won’t engage in idle, so I’ve left them there - I don’t mind a slow spin just to make sure all 4 motors engage at the same time. However, playing with the THR_MIN (basically adjusting it down) I notice weird things happening (right now I have THR_MIN set to 75), and the moment I give a little bit of stick, one of the motors will actually STOP while the others rev up.

A nice range would be 997 - 2006. When the Pixhawk powers the ESC’s it starts at 1010 and goes up which is going to cause your motors to spin to fast.  Either get a new radio or recalibrate the range or even use the trim tabs and get it closer to a normal range.  You will have to redo the ESC calibration after that.

It turned out that the actual problem was the ESC’s somehow lost their calibration. Did a recalibration and that fixed it. I have a theory on why this may have happened…I’m using deans connectors from the bats and the connection does not always fit smoothly resulting in a brief partial connection which may have erased the calibration. An ESC recalibration might be the solution for everyone re this issue. Thanks again for your thoughts.

Also worth to try setting the various thrust curve params."

This is happening on my Walkera 350 quad. Was flying fine last week until I upgraded MP today and wanted to make a minor adjustment to the Pitch and Roll. Now there is really no slow throttle past startup at idle speed. Increase the throttle just a hair and the motors spin up well over 50%. I don’t dare put the props on or it will fly away and the only way to get the RPM down is to disarm the copter. I am going to try and download the previous version and reload the software so I can use the quad and will just wait for this bug to be resolved.

The machine flies great, but there’s definetely something wrong with the throttle config, and today the wind almost bumped it over while I was waiting for the “last” motor to engage. So, all in all: To high THR_MIN and the thing is hard to land, since there’s nothing between idle and hover rpms. Too low THR_MIN and all 4 motors don’t engage at the same time.

I can see in mission planner that the pixhawk gives different values to the 4 motors, so this is a 100% apm problem as far as I can see)",I am having the same issue with my quad.  I am running the latest BLHeli firmware on my ESCs and the throttle effect is exactly as you describe.  This was never a problem with 3.2.1.  Is there a configuration setting I need to make to address this?
215,Problems with Idle throttle (Copter 3.3.3),16,"Hi all, Hopefully someone can help me with this: I don’t know if my ESCs are super-sensitive or what but here goes: When I arm my quad using the default settings, all 4 motors will start at a fairly high RPM (almost enough to lift off). There is no “gap” between too much power and zero power (I had to “jump-land” my quad when testing this the first time, not a fun experience with a shiny new unit  ). I can see that if I set MOT_SPIN_ARMED to anything below 70, the motors won’t engage in idle, so I’ve left them there - I don’t mind a slow spin just to make sure all 4 motors engage at the same time. However, playing with the THR_MIN (basically adjusting it down) I notice weird things happening (right now I have THR_MIN set to 75), and the moment I give a little bit of stick, one of the motors will actually STOP while the others rev up. If I continue to give throttle slowly the stopped motor will engage at around 25% throttle.

(btw, this is not an ESC issue. I can see in mission planner that the pixhawk gives different values to the 4 motors, so this is a 100% apm problem as far as I can see)","I can just reiterate on my solution (workaround) to this problem since many are experiencing the same:  use mission planner’s motor test to determine the lowest number that will spin the motors. Normally around 7-8. use the value from the previous step x10 as a starting point for idle speed (so 7 --> 70). Experiment with lower and lower numbers (69, 68, 67 etc) while keeping an eye on the pwm out to one of the motors (again using mission planner). At some point as you reduce the idle number the pwm will stop reducing and instead start increasing. (Let’s say this will happen at idle value 65). This means that idle 66 is the lowest idle spin you’ll get from your setup.  The fact that pwm starts increasing at some point is obviously a bug or caused by something at least I’m not bright enough to understand, but the outline above is a workaround I’ve used two setups. Both of them rather overpowered (which is what I think is the root cause of the effect)"

I have found, especially with new builds, that they drift on take off with no stick input to pitch or roll. So, either try to jump it off the ground, only needs to be a few centimetres, not a few meters, or apply some corrective stick input while attempting to do it so slowly. You also have not let it go very far before cutting the throttle. If you are doing auto missions you will note that auto takeoff is quick, it does not hang about near the ground. The bigger props might have altered the response time considerably, so do not expect the same flight characteristics, and PID tuning might be needed."

217,Bad Gyro Health & Can't calibrate,0,"Hi all, I have a Genuian 3DR Pixhawk that’s about 7 months old and I keep getting this issue with it, it randomly refused to calibrate gyros on MP or any of the software When I click to start it either just skips steps or jumps to failed, so it may allow me to do the first two then skip a step completely then fails it will also give bad gyro health error. No matter what I do, in a frame, out of a frame or anything it’s completely random, it’s been on the shelf for 4 months pulley it off today just bare bone FC, updated to V3.3.3 and it started, after about 40 minutes of messing it just worked and it calibrated. This is driving me insane it been like this for months and no matter the FW or what’s connected it does it. Here is a video demo of it from some time back but nothing has changed, on latest MP as of today and nothing changes it. Second question that’s very basic TBH but I don’t fully understand, what is the different between the Ardicopter FW Quad and Hexa as I can then also change the frame type in Mandatory hardware to either of these regardless of FW Does the FW downloaded contain both quad and hex or is the selection of a different frame in Frame type not actually changing setting.

218,Upgrade to 3.3.2 Alt Hold rising full trottle up,1,"Hi All ! My Pixhawk is installed on Mariner quad (500). With the version 3.2 it has many nice flights, with very good ALT Hold control and AUTO flights.

Sometimes the rise up is hard to compensate with the trottle… Looking at the logs, all seems OK, except the inconsistency in the IMU - accelerometers 1 and 2 shows different phase after switching to Alt Hold.

You need to dampen the Pixhawk better. Even small vibrations will cause this to happen. And its hard to find a good vibration dampening material. But here is a thing that will help you alot:  Open your pix, and add weight to the bottom plasic case (about 15-20g). Secure it in the middle of the case. Use a dampening silicon material in the top case, so the board can´t move at all. It should be thick enough   to put pressure on the board when you close the case. Use 3M 2mm double sided tape to mount the Pixhawk, as close to origo/CoG as possible.  This will very likely help with your issues. We now use this method on all our large UAV´s using Pixhawk. We had the exact same issues as you before. Reason is the poorly designed Pixhawk, with IMU mounted without dampening."

With that I am using a power supply to mimic the (14.7V, 4S, 6600mah) battery into the drone until I get authorization. Does this really make much of a difference in properly configuring the ESC?

228,GPS loss and crash,1,"Dear All, I have recently done some test flights with my Pixhawk powered Y6. The flights were typically either vertical (going up and down at 300m away from me) or in a circle around me (also at about 300m radius). The 4th flight was one of the horizontal circle flights and I repeated it for the 5th flight (exact same flight path). This time shortly after switching to Auto the copter seemed to loose altitude and then started to roll and pitch violently after crashing into the trees about 20m below it. After viewing the data log I could see that both GPS receivers lost all their satellites at once, then one of the receivers regained satellites for a short period after which it lost again all satellites. Shortly thereafter I assumed it must have crashed as the logs just stopped. The GPS receivers were from two different manufacturers, the first being the Ublox 3DR receiver and the second a RTK receiver running as a normal GPS receiver. My question is obviously, what happened and how can I prevent this from happening again. I just flew the flight plan and repeated the exact same one. If it was external influences then why did all go well the first time. How can it just instantaneously loose both GPS receivers like that. Furthermore if I lost GPS signal the parameter FS_EKA_ACTION = 1 which means it should then just have landed right. Maybe it did try to land but how can I see that from the data log?

This concerns me as I am fitting an RTK GPS to an Octo at the moment. What make of RTK GP{S are you using? From the log: Altitude Estimate Divergence between POS.Alt and GPS and GPS2 is happening a lot. Is the Pixhawk bar exposed or subject to pressure changes? The attitude controller is also having problems with “The autopilot reports both the craft’s attitude and the attitude the craft believes it should be at” with a lot of motor clipping both low and high. At first it is short duration with no motor clipping but once the duration gets above 3seconds the log indicates motor clipping. How well tuned is this copter? Could it be getting into oscillations that increase to the point of non recovery? Motors 2-4-6 seem to be clipping high the most towards the end. The log analyser is also indicating “Severe scheduler overruns” so the flight controller seems to have really lost its shit before crashing. I have seen in the forums where the Dev’s recommend not to use 2 GPS’s at the moment. I hope this is corrected soon but at present I will be setting the RTK GPS as the only external. By the look of it the internal schedular can’t handle it and flips out, which may be the cause, or just a contributing factor combined with the tune. Just a few observations that I hope helps."
228,GPS loss and crash,2,"Dear All, I have recently done some test flights with my Pixhawk powered Y6. The flights were typically either vertical (going up and down at 300m away from me) or in a circle around me (also at about 300m radius). The 4th flight was one of the horizontal circle flights and I repeated it for the 5th flight (exact same flight path). This time shortly after switching to Auto the copter seemed to loose altitude and then started to roll and pitch violently after crashing into the trees about 20m below it. After viewing the data log I could see that both GPS receivers lost all their satellites at once, then one of the receivers regained satellites for a short period after which it lost again all satellites. Shortly thereafter I assumed it must have crashed as the logs just stopped. The GPS receivers were from two different manufacturers, the first being the Ublox 3DR receiver and the second a RTK receiver running as a normal GPS receiver. My question is obviously, what happened and how can I prevent this from happening again. I just flew the flight plan and repeated the exact same one. If it was external influences then why did all go well the first time. How can it just instantaneously loose both GPS receivers like that. Furthermore if I lost GPS signal the parameter FS_EKA_ACTION = 1 which means it should then just have landed right. Maybe it did try to land but how can I see that from the data log?

Thanks for your time The link to the bin file (20MB) is here: *","Hi Mike, Thanks a lot for taking the time to look at the log. The RTK GPS is from a French company called Drotek (*). To get a better idea of what went wrong and also allowing me to read future logs, could you help me in understanding the issues you mentioned. “Altitude Estimate Divergence between POS.Alt and GPS and GPS2 is happening a lot”: I plotted POS.Alt, GPS.Alt and GPS2.Alt and the two GPS’s seems to follow each other fairly close while POS seems to have an offset. I thought this would be normal since POS is a filtered value and would differ from the GPS values. In some cases I noted a small difference between the GPS and GPS2 altitude but I suppose this could be due to the receive sensitivities of the GPS receivers that might be different (one also receiving GLONASS and GPS while the other just receive GPS). Could you elaborate more what you meant with this statement? The Pixhawk was enclosed inside the frame of the copter so there would normally not have been large pressure changes, it was also not really windy or cloudy on the day. The attitude controller is also having problems with “The autopilot reports both the craft’s attitude and the attitude the craft believes it should be at”: Where can I see this, I looked at ATT.DesRoll compared with ATT.Roll and did the same for pitch and yaw. Here I can also see that at the end the Pixhawk could for sure not control the copter anymore. “lot of motor clipping both low and high”: I checked RCOU.Ch1 through to RCOU.Ch6 and can see that all channels clip at the bottom during landing and like you mentioned 2,4 and 6 clips towards the end. Channels 2,4 and 6 are from the top mounted motors or the Y6B frame. Is this clipping a bad thing or does it just show that the motors worked at full throttle? I tuned another copter which is supposed to be exactly the same and just copied the parameters to this one, maybe not the wises thing to have done I suppose. I think you are right about the copter going into an oscillation from which it could not recover but what caused it to go into this state? “Severe scheduler overruns”: Not sure where I should look for this, maybe the PM logs should provide more details. I guess this means some tasks took longer than the scheduled time causing other tasks to slow down. Then like you mentioned the autopilot could probably not perform critical tasks fast enough causing the crash. It would however be interesting to know when this severe scheduler overrun occurred and why it “triggered” at that moment. As a side question, how can I see from the logs if a fail-safe condition was triggered. Apparently there should be a ERR log but I can’t find it? This is a very valuable exercise for me in understanding the autopilot behaviour better, thanks for the very valuable input and help that you provided! I also hope that we could soon run 2 GPS units without any surprises. For now I also think you have the correct approach in using just a GPS and making it RTK."

I understand 3.4 has changed the terminology for “Stabilize rate P” regardless, it sounds like this is to low.  I suggest after reading the wiki sections on tuning the PID settings, you manually change the stabilize rate p.  First, increase the rate P by say, 20%, then arm and slowly increase throttle, don’t let it take off, just see if the flipping movement gets better or worse.  If it improved then adjust rate P even higher, If it got worse, adjust lower.  In the beginning you will need to provide some correction at take off.

231,Crash on first flight after mayor crash,1,"Hi, I had a very bad crash a while ago.

Have you done all the compass calibrations including compass mot? Is there current carrying wires near the compass? Are you using any FPV or similar Tx that might be screwing with the GPS? Interestingly there was also some gyro drift present. Have you recalibrate everything after the first crash? Is this a genuine 3DR Pixhawk? The reason I ask this is because I have seen a few clones that seem to have used substandard gyro/accel chips that cause problems. A test I often do is to leave the FC connected to the GCS, usually via USB, for a couple of hours to see just how stable the gyros are. One problem FC from HK was spinning the artificial horizon like a top after 2 hours."

Log files are * Cheers, Tim 160630-1914PST Anyone??? *, * Should this be posted elsewhere?","Tim, One thing I notice is that the compass orientation is “8”.  On a pixhawk with an external compass it’s normally zero assuming the arrow on the GPS/compass is pointed in the same direction as the flight controller. The CPU errors in log 10.bin come from the *.  This is triggered if the main loop becomes stalled for 2 seconds.  So in this log it appears the CPU froze up for about 40seconds which is quite unusual and I can’t explain what caused it.  As far as I can tell the vehicle was not flying at the time though.  Besides this one event the performance (shown in the “PM” log message) looks normal with only a small number of loop (normally less than 20) running longer than the ideal 2.5ms.  So I guess this even is not related to the vehicle flying erratically. The EKF_CHECK-2 and FAILSAFE_EKF error messages are more likely related to the problems you’re seeing.  What’s happened in this even is the EKF (the position and attitude estimation system) is having a hard time putting all the sensor data together into a consistent estimate.  It looks to me like it’s the compass that’s the issue. The GPS quality is fine, and vibration levels are reasonable.  Even the compass vs throttle looks ok meaning that it’s likely not that the compass is too close to power wires.  My bet is that the compass orientation parameter is the issue.  Maybe try making that zero and see if it solves the problem."

This will cause a battery voltage drop under load of a couple of volts.  I have a battery with over 400 flights on it and it drops below 3 volts per cell.

236,EKF: Compass Variance After Landing,1,"Hello, I have a recurring issue I’m looking to solve; After a flight, right after the landing, I’m getting “PreArm: EKF compass variance” and the pixhawk won’t arm again - Meaning I need to take out the battery between flights. This problem reproduces on every flight. What could be the issue? Where should I look to debug this? A log file is attached Thanks Nitay","Hi, I seem to have missed a key point in the log here - There is a big mismatch between the 2 compasses Z values. The external compass (compass 1) gets a constant error after the engines start. (See Mag.MagZ vs Mag2.MagZ vs ThrOut) I don’t think it’s a Compass-Motor mag field problem because the log shows a (big) constant error and not a disturbance The compass in this build is not elevated above the quad (on the same plane as the motors, in the middle of the quad. The quad is 550mm diagonal), however I don’t remember ever having this problem. Any idea of what can cause such a problem? I’ll try and replace the compass anyway"

237,MinumOSD not displaying 3dfix and sats,1,Good day everyone. Had to change my GPS to serial 4/5 as its seems Serial 3 port is busted. Everything works fine and getting good GPS signal as per Mission planner but sine the change no GPS info and 3dfix is displayed on my OSD. I am getting battery V and A displayed just not the GPS info,OSD reads the Mavlink messages that have nothing to do with the hardware so it must not be sending that data anymore.  I would check the serial configuration to see that it is enable to send those messages. It could also be sending them as GPS2 instead of just GPS.  Would need to see the mavlink stream to see what the messages look like. Mike

You switched many times to different modes and what I could see the copter was following the set Altitude with no issues. I fly all the time with my Pixhawk in the open with nothing around it and have seen no issue with Altitude hold.  What I have seen is if I fly full forward the copter will start to loose Altitude as it flies but this is indicated in the logs. Not seeing this in your logs. You need to build a Mission with several waypoints that are far apart so we can see what your talking about.  Set the altitude at 20 or 30 meters so it will take some time before it hits the ground.

243,Availability of CH9/CH12_OPT in AC3.3.3,0,"Hi, Am using AC3.3.3 on Pixhawk, Frsky X4R SBUS and Taranis. I am trying to get more flight modes using CH9_OPT upwards, but telemetry to MP did not register the additional mode changes.  The Taranis channel monitor do reflect the additional channels, and X4R SBUS should be carrying the extra channels to the Pixhawk, but I couldn’t verify this yet.  I would like to check whether the CHx_OPT features are available on 3.3.3, or only on 3.4rc?  If confirm available, then I would do more troubleshooting. Do I need to set other parameters besides CHx_OPT?  Thanks for any pointers, would be great to have additional control modes on my drones.",

I switched out the Pixhawk for a Pix Lite (Pixhawk varient) which the loiter does work on, loaded the Pixhawk parameters, and guess what the Loiter still didn’t work. Clearly this told me that the issue was a parameter issue. I reset all the parameters back to default in V3.3.3 and then manually updated the important parameters, recalibrated everything, etc… and voila the Loiter worked. I then saved and loaded these new parameters from the Pix Lite onto the Pixhawk, switched out the FCs, and now the Loiter works on the original Pixhawk. I can only surmise that updating the firmware before on the Pixhawk did something odd with the parameters which caused the issue."

245,Activating two relay signals from a hand controller,1,"I’m trying to activate two separate devices from my Pixhawk on an X8 using the aux outputs as relay signals. I’m able to get Ch7 on my hand controller to activate the relay signal on AUXOUT6 by following these steps:   Under Config/Tuning -> Standard Params -> First Relay Pin (RELAY_PIN), I selected “Pixhawk AUXOUT6” from the drop down menu.   Under Extended Tuning, next to Ch7 Opt, I selected “Relay On/Off” from the drop down menu.   And that works great. I can flip the Ch7 switch on my controller back and forth and see the signal go up and down. So now I want to add a second relay control to Ch8 of my hand controller. Similar to above, I set the Second Relay Pin to “Pixhawk AUXOUT5” on the Standard Params page. But the only available options for Ch8 are “Relay On/Off”, which only works on the first relay. I can’t find a way to set Ch8 to control the second relay. Am I missing an option somewhere or is it impossible to control two separate relay signals on a Pixhawk from a hand controller?",Right now the only way to activate a second and third relay is to use a mission command.

I wrapped the carbon tube with a single layer of selotape before sliding on the motor mount to provide grip. fnoop - good call on switching the motor around. I will do that. One other mod I carried out yesterday is to remove the pixhawk mounts I had made and replace them. Before I had 1cm x 2cm oblong pieces of the orange HK foam with a piece of double sided foam tape on either side - one of these in each corner of the pixhawk - this gave excellent vibration dampening, but at the expense of the flight controller not being solidly held in place - My impression was that a twitch on the frame would likely cause the FC to be thrown excessively in the direction of movement, so excessive movement on the part of the FC. So I decided to stiffen up the mount by using some thinner and firmer 4.5mm foam, which is sticky on one side only, which meant some double sided tape on the non-sticky side - I have added a 1cm strip of this along the full width of the FC at each end. Hoping it will maintain vibration dampening whilst providing more stability for mora accurate IMU measurements. I took it for a flight tonight - it was a bit windy, but it was clear that the PIDs are far too high now. They were a tad high before (since my auto-tuning at the weekend) but this flight demonstrated that they were a tad beyond acceptable limits, so need some manual tuning to get the best results.

This is the YT video I was referring to in an earlier post: * he refers to the anti-vibe mounts as “vibration inducing”!"
248,VibeZ worse on one motor,14,"I have been doing some vibration testing today on my Tarot 680Pro hexa (setup in hexa-x layout), with Sunnysky x4108s kv690 motors. 5 of the motors are almost vibration free with VibeX, VibeY and VibeZ all under 2, when I spin the motors individually upto 80% of full. One motor however (motor 5) has its VibeZ reading shoot upto 15 - (mean value is 7), but strangely the graph shows regularly changing spikes between 2 and 15, whilst all other motors give fairly smooth lines. So wondering what could cause this rapidly changing vibe reading on the Z axis of this one motor. These are the things I have tried so far:  I have switched 3 props on this motor, all statically balanced to perfection. Made no difference! I have tested for bell end-float on this motor and there is none. Checked bearings are are in perfect condition I have tried balancing the bell by adding tape and moving it around, but see no real improvement on the Zvibe reading, so thinking its not a bell balancing issue. I checked the motor timing value set on the X-Rotor 40A ESC and it is correctly set to intermediate timing ( I don’t hear any timing issues to be honest, but thought I’d check this one was set as per the others).  I realise that these are very low vibe readings and I probably shouldn’t be concerned, but I am just curious why this one motor is so different from the other 5. (to the point where I have just ordered another motor! Any thoughts would be gratefully received. I’ll post to report results of the new motor once it arrives - could be 4 weeks from GLB in China.","fnoop - I followed your suggestion…, swapped my vibey motor with the least vibey one, and the vibes stayed with the same arm/mount. I then swapped the props between this vibey motor with one from a motor with no vibes and again, the vibes stayed with the arm/mount position, so I can only conclude that this arm is somehow attracting more vibration than any of the others. The vibey arm is front right, and on this same arm I have the GPS mounted on a pole, so wondering if the gps is getting vibes induced from the motor, and this in turn is amplifying those vibes into the arm. Its also one of the folding arms for which the hinge point lies directly under the front right corner of the pixhawk, so wondering if this is where the IMU is located and perhaps it just reads more vibes from this arm due to the locality of this inboard end of the arm. In any case, I think I’m going to give up trying to solve an issue which is probably not relevent. My overall vibe readings peak at around 25 whilst in flight, which is under the recommended limit of 30, so I’m hoping this is good enough. I get zero vibe clipping in flight. Fnoop - would you be willing to attach one of your dataflash logs from your 680Pro? Is your’s running on 4s or 6s? If 4s, then it could be a good comparison - I’d like to compare the vibe values to see how mine stacks up. I’ve seen really varied vibe levels on the logs in posts in this forum, some super low and some crazy high (although these tend to be logs from copters with issues!)"
249,Quad Firmware with Octocopter setup,1,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone has experimented running quad copter firmware on an octocopter style frame? What I mean is instead of a traditional octo where every second motor spins CCW and every other CW, I want to have motors A and B spinning in the same direction, C and D spinning the opposite, E and F the same as A and B, G and H as C and D? Basically I want a coaxial quad setup with the efficiency of an octocopter and only require 4 motor output signals.I will split the output signal for motor 1 to the ESCs of motors A and B, the motor signalfor motor 2 to the motors E and F and so on… Is there any reason this won’t work? Regards, Cameron","For those that are curious, the aircraft had no problem dealing with this configuration. I don’t think it works properly if you lose a motor though as you end up loading up one of the motors."

I really need someone smarter then me to check my log and tell me what is causing the altitude gain and Err: EKF_CHECK-2.,The vibration increase seems to be what triggered your FS_EKF and it happens that a lot of Z axis vibration causes rapid changes in altitude. That rapid vibration increase also corresponds to large spikes in current draw and a maxing out of motor outputs. This is all happening prior to the EKF error. Looks like a mechanical failure. Your RC input is also very noisy as an aside.

252,LOG of a very mysterious crash,1,"Hello everyone: Today I flew again my quadcopter after 6 months of getting new parts from another crash (also due to an undetermined cause) in January.

Actually, and looking back, I can only blame EM interference on the GPS, although it was mounted on one of those elevated poles, and well fixed, too… As a matter of fact, it had a GPS lock. It would not even arm if it did not, as I did not disable any of the pre-arm checks. One more thing I have been wondering: could there have been a conflict between Copter failsafes and the radio (FrSky Taranis) failsafe? I did not set any specific failsafe on the radio, but I don’t know if it assumes anything by default… About the FAA number, I don’t have nor can’t have one, as I don’t live in the US, but in Portugal.

After the fly away, it would not loiter reliably, and would usually change altitude rapidly or move around.  I spent a lot of time fixing the powering: disconnecting all BEC inputs from the ESCs, checking grounds.  I also had an issue with barometer accuracy, which I found through logs.  I also checked logs from all test flights and tried to track down any error messages, like GPS errors, and see if I could fix them with adjustments to the build or parameters.  I also consistently checked and turned off all failsafes and fences, as they seemed to turn themselves on at random (?) and did not really help me.

What I can tell you is that it is a mistake to fly without telemetry especially for your first flight. It is a little bit like starting a car you have just build without the gauges under the eyes : you do not know what is the status bad or good of your vehicle before taking off. What happened most probably is that you took off without having a GPS lock (can take long minutes sometimes befoire take off); then when you triggered RTL the copter went to the (wrong) home position. Next time, NEVER NEVER fly your drone with some form of telemetry (be it a tablet or a PC or even OSD on your video downlink), so that you can check the preflight conditions. Good luck, Hugues"

So the fact that you have GPS lock on the ground and are able to arm is no guarantee you will keep GPS lock in the air. And if you lose GPS lock, anything can happen if RTL is triggered. If the flight controller knows where home is, but doesn’t know where the drone is - trouble. So I wouldn’t personally test RTL on the first flight of a brand new set-up, until I had flight logs and could see there were no GPS errors happening mid-flight. Or in your case, if telemetry tells you, mid-flight, the same thing, you should be safer. George"
259,RTL lost my drone,22,"Hi, I am afraid my first message in this forum is a not so happy one. After about one month building, programming and testing a custom DJI F450 with Pixhawk, I went to a nearby park to fly it.

I spent around 2 hours looking for it in the vicinity of the park, bu without success. I am sure I followed every recommendation: I set all the failsafes, I let it acquire GPS satellites before I armed and flew it, I did everything… Can anyone help me find what went wrong?

The Taranis or - better - the X8R receiver must be setup in order to follow a behaviour in case the radio link should be broken (radio off, radio battery down etc.). How can we setup both the Pixhawk and the X8R so the FCU will control the RTL? There are two kinds of RTL: voluntary RTL flight mode set by the pilot, and RTL due to radio TX/RX issues."

A good way to check for this, is to take off and land under stabilize or a mode like alt-hold (and avoid using a gps mode) where you can look at the logs after and see if the GPS maintained under all circumstances. Check the UBX messages in the dataflash .bin. The important ones are jamInd, noiseperms and acgCnt. This thread has some good info on those values and EKF variables to monitor related to GPS"

261,Descent issues in LOITER/POSHOLD-Mode,1,"Hi, already with my last copter I observed high descent rates on fast movements. I thought it was a little bit underpowered. But now my current copter is kind of overpowered (in stabilize mode it reaches 25-30m climb rate) and the issue remains. Once the angle goes over aprox. 25-30 degrees, it descents continuously and is only recoverable by increasing the thrust. As far as I know, the ALTHOLD-algorithm should maintain the height in these modes and automaticly adjust the thrust. Sounds it like a sensor issue, a parameter issue, or is it just a known issue? Bjoern",This has nothing to do with power and everything to do with the way the barometer on the Pixhawk acts when moving at a rapid rate laterally.  It creates a bit of a low pressure area around the FC which tricks it into thinking it’s ascending a little bit when it actually isn’t.  There are probably several topics that allude to this.

Before trying this out I messed with different foam cover directly on the barometer but still has the issue with fast forward flight.  Since I can’t use a dome I just thought of surrounding the pixhawk with something to keep wind from hitting the fc. *

263,Setting up a compass with a Pixhawk (or AUAV X2),1,"I must confess to being rusty with Pixhawk (I have been using 8 bit copter). There are a couple of things that really make things tricky and could maybe be addressed.   If you are using a new external compass that is faulty as I was, you get no indication of the external compass bearing in the same way as you used to with APM 2.6. It would be nice at least have a test mode that you could use on the bench to see this.   If you are using a new ( and expensive one from CSG shop) GPS/Compass that is functioning but has incorrect x and Y arrows and no forward arrow it gets really hard as again you get no accurate bearing of the actual mag heading as EKF disregards it and throws an EKF error.   Is it the case that the compass orientation has changed from Roll 180 to None with PX4 as opposed to APM 2.6 in Mission Planner? The mag is still inverted, is it not?   I feel the entire compass set up can be unduly difficult now (versus 8 bit scenario). I wonder if it would be worth having a test mode where you could see the unfiltered movement of the external compass and test basic functionality. Also, to what extent is the internal compass used in EKF even though you have disabled it. For example I was having a tough time with the proximity of a buzzer with a magnet near the FC causing bench EKF errors (I think) and I did not realize what was going on for a long time. I seem to have hit most of the pitfalls here and I am wondering if the process could me made a little easier to debug. I appreciate the benefits of EKF but it can really obscure set-up problems, even for relatively experienced people using non-3DR hardware–which is the reality today. Just to be able to see your primary compass bearings in MP would be a great help – even if it was just a test function. I now have an APM 2.6 around just for testing compasses. Seems silly to have to do that. Just my 2 cents.","Hello there. As a new Pixhawk user I find the whole compass setup a nightmare. Yes, sure it works with only the internal mag, but adding an external one forced me to abandon some flights as I was either not able to arm (inconsistent compass), or lately crushed (EKF variance in flight and not able to switch on any GPS mode). The ability to SEE live compasses and EKF/DCM data would be a great help."
264,Compass variance known problem?,1,We have been using 3.3 in our copters for a while now and we see a lot of issues with compass variance. We are quite sure there some be something in the code that is triggering these errors as it happens with a bare pixhawk on the table. In our particular case we sit a standalone pixhawk in a table and connect with usb. We connect thru mission planner and elf is OK. We take it and give 180deg yaw turn and elf is red. Why? Same happens in flight with external compasses etc. I have even seen a small toilet bowl one of the times . We know it is not interference as it happens with no motors running and as mentioned with a standalone pixhawk. If we install 3.2.1. everything goes smooth. So any ideas? Thanks !!,Check your compass offsets.  There is a bug in 3.3 that will change the offsets on the fly for you.  I would write them down and see if they are changing. Mike

Thought I’d try absolute altitude in Mission Planner instead of relative.  I’ve getting the first field populated with a 20 on takeoff which as I found out the climb angle for a plane…  So I’m thinking it’s not supported.  Anyone know? *,
269,YAW P and I extremely high,0,The max P for YAW is supposed to be .5 and .05 for I.  Every time I do an autotune I get 1.4 to 1.5 for P and .14 to .15 for I.  Got a really good autotune for pitch and roll and yaw seems fine as well.  Put the yaw to default .2 and .02 and you can see it twisting as it does auto missions.  Do anything above .5 and .05 even do anything as it’s beyond the max values.,

271,Flight time reduced in half,1,"I had Naza v2. and flight time was about 17-18min, recently decided to try APM 2.8 3.3.3v for quadrocopter.

When the OSD indicates 50%-55% how much do you actually have to put back into the batteries when charging? Is it 50% to 55%? If this is the case then the numbers add up that you will get the right flight time, it’s just a matter of finding why you “lose power” at 50% indicated. Can you post a log?"

I guess it must form a low pressure zone (behind a high-pressure wake?), which looks like it is higher than it should be, so it decends to get the pressure back up.

273,Pixhawk Telemetry Setup,0,"Hello, gentlemen. I’m learning step by step about Pixhawk. Thanks to valuable advice and posts here, I can manage to solve many problems and succeed in setting up a very stable and crisp flight. But another problem has come up to me. I attached telemetry system to my Hexacopter. I set up the radio according to the Arducopter’s instruction. But strangely during the last flight, the connection was cut off intermittently and the symptom got worse if the drone went farther away more than 10 meters or so. Now I’m checking the setting process again. And I found something strange. My question is~~ In the telemetry setting screen, why doesn’t the information about version ,frequency and device appear on the top of the right Remote Panel? By any chance, is it related with the connection problem? Thank you in advance for you kind help. *",

The Pixhawk appears to have passed the pre-arm safety checks, as the the LED flashes regular green suggesting that it is ready to be armed. The problem lies with the safety switch not responding to a 2-3 sec press. Very occasionally it may do so first time, but mostly it won’t respond for several minutes; all the while the LED is flashing green and no spoken system problems. The GCS gives no indication of any problems. Once I am able to press and get it into a ready state, the GCS will tell me it is armed when holding the throttle down and right. Then the system works normally. Phil"

275,AltHold Algorithm Bug,1,"Hello Friends I posted my problems in connection with overshooting in the AltHold mode a few months ago on DIYDrones. But nobody really listen… Today I did some aerial footage for a commercial. It was windy but I saw no reason to don’t start. I waited in the the Loiter Mode until I get the order to fly forward. Suddenly my X8 coax copter nearly did a backflip… I switch immediately to the Stabilize Mode and the multicopter leveled horizontally. After that I landed and finished the drone shots. I went home and did a comparison test between the AltHold Mode and the Stabilize Mode. The goal was to fly forward and to slow down the flight speed by push the transmitter stick to the neutral position. So, no aggressive brake maneuver. Here it is in the AltHold Mode, you can clearly see that the multicopter overshoots. :       And the same maneuver in Stabilze:       You can clearly see a difference between the flight modes. I got this problem also during shoots early this year. We said, it must be the weather conditions, maybe to windy… But no, in my opinion it’s a problem with the AltHold mode and all other modes who relate to them. I hope you guys find a solution for this. It’s only a matter of time til a multicopter crashes and hopefully nobody get injured… Here is my setup: V 3.3.3 / 3DR Pixhawk X8 Coax Here is the log from the test: * BTW, I have the same problem with other X8 coax multicopter… Thanks a lot Michael",I too had a copter that flew just fine until one day I was flying into windy conditions and it would suddenly take off.  The funny thing was it was only going into the wind and not away.  For a while this was kind of fun until I flew it in very windy conditions and it shot up 20 meters into the air and flipped over mid flight over me.  I quickly switched to stabilize and cut the throttle.  I was able to give it a little throttle and get it to right itself and then get it to softly land. The problem was that I mounted the Pixhawk directly on the copter with a piece of Velcro.  That way if I wanted to move it I could just pick it off.  It turns out that as the copter flies into the wind it generated a huge amount of vibration in the Z axes that misleads the flight controller into thinking its falling and corrects buy giving it full throttle. I thought the flight controller should not do this but that’s what it does and still does.  I then mounted the unit on a foam platform and the problem was gone. I looked at your logs and see the same conditions.  The vibrations in the Z axes are high and I can see the throttle going to full. Mike

The strange thing is, that that I have those problems since maybe 6 month. Before I never got issues like this.

280,Can't find INAV_TC_Z,1,I have a drop after going forward in althold. I need to change my thr_mid and maybe the INAV_TC_Z from 5 to maybe 6 or 7. I can’t find the option if I search for it in the full parameter list. Why? I do have ac 3.3.3 and mission planner on windows. My fc is a pixhawk from 3dr x8+ copter. Anyone? Thanks,Is this parameter helping to avoid a drop after releasing the sticks  in althold. EKF_ALT_NOISE?
281,640 size quad lot's of inertia,1,"Hello I have a 370 quad with a naza mv2 and i just build a 640 size with the pixhawk. the 640/pixhawk seems to be very sluggish when responding to commands, meaning if I input some pitch and then stop, the drone will keep moving forward. trying to understand if it is because of the size and my setup/configuration. I am running 3.3.3 and 15inch prop thank you Gabe",Its most likely due to your PI gain settings. Depending on the size of your quad these parameters need to be changed as they are a constant feedback into your system for correcting those sluggish movements and setting how twitchy you want your system to be. These parameters can be changed in mission planner and is very much a trial and error method to getting the right values for your personal quad unless you know how to calculate them by hand.

This PI Gain settings are just numbers to which to feed into the motors to counter a change in direction. so therefore they need to personalised to your quad

282,Need help interpreting logs for bad crash. Was this caused by gyro drift?,1,"Hello Everyone, About a month ago I experienced a bad crash of my (clone) Pixhawk driven quad.  This crash resulted in the total destruction of the quad and also nearly destroyed a $500 window. The experience was very disconcerting for me, and I decided I would not fly again until I had understood what went wrong. Flight was in a field near a house.  I was standing on the back porch.  I was practicing maneuvers in Stabilize mode and then at one point I heard an EKF Error announced.  A few moments later the quad started leaning towards me and accelerated in my direction.  It was non-responsive to controls at this point.  Fortunately it missed me but it slammed full speed into the house, destroying itself and nearly taking out a brand new window.  The crash was hard enough to leave 1/2"" dents in the siding of the house. So what happened? I have been looking at the log files since the crash, and feel that the crash is possibly related to IMU.GYRY and IMU2.GYRY drifting apart by (what appears to be) a small amount.  Is this the gyro drift issue that others had seen in the past?  Or was this caused by aliasing due to some high-frequency vibration which doesn’t seem to appear in the logs?

Here is the link to the log file: * Thank you! -Geoffrey",To be clear it’s not gyro drift but GPS drift.  From the logs you expirenced the worst case I have seen.  More than likely the trees to the south of the home caused the drift. What happens is the GPS suddenly thinks that it is several meters away from it’s current position and tells the copter to move in the opposite direction to correct for this. To see this for yourself open your log in Mission Planner and select Mechanical Failure from the drop down.  Now click on the Show Map check box to see your position and the graph side by side.  From there resize the graph so that its have the screen in the middle.  Now double click on spots in the graph on the left and notice the tier drop move on the right.  This is where the GPS thinks the copter is.  As you click points closer to the end of the log you will notice that the copter flies off to the East which cause the copter to fly at you at full throttle. Mike

Let’s for the time being assume that stabilize mode is not using the GPS. The difference in gyroscope (GYRY) between IMU and IMU2 indicates to me that one of the IMUs has failed.  It should not be possible for these gyroscopes to have a consistent mismatch like this, since the gyros are effectively measuring changes in rotational velocity. This looks to me like one of the gyros has started producing some sort of offset in addition to the delta v it is supposed to be measuring.  I can imagine that any sort of offset in the gyro output would wreak havok on the EKF as it is attempting to do estimate vehicle posture. Thoughts?"

I did the ESC calibration recommended on *, and during the calibration, spun up the motors.  At a certain speed, the copter pitched backwards towards me slightly (I left the blades on), which was odd that equal power did not seem to be distributed.

You need to establish that each step is right. I would suggest redoing the calibration without the props on. After the calibration you should be able to move the throttle between minimum and maximum throttle and hear that your motors are responding correctly.

I checked mission planner for a potential error warning that there might be and none show.  Regardless, I disabled the pre-flight safety checks.  When the quad is plugged into mission planner, the quad motors arm and continue to spin at their minimum armed speed.  I tried arming the quad plugged into mission planner and then unplugging, but the motors stopped spinning.  Any help anyone can provide is greatly appreciated, thank you all for your time.","Exactly what ESC are you using? Sounds like they have “Helicopter mode” activated. This is a mode which limits the delta v of the motors. In other words you (simplified) tell the ESC that ""Ok, I want a X second long ramp up/ramp down time to/from max throttle. This is useful in “normal” helicopters to limit the torque stress due to the intertia of the main rotor/transmission. In calibration mode they will respond instantly as you typically perform this with the motor disconnected from the transmission, and because it is useful to provide instant feedback to the person performing the calibration. Check your ESC manual if this may be the case. Some ESC’s are programmable via external hardware, some are programmable wia stick input."

286,Pixhawk no TX stick control during flight with 360 yaw,1,"This is a new build with successful flights all week, the last, I had total lack of stick control in Loiter mode. Did have flight mode control.  On takeoff it started a 360 degree Yaw and was about 15/20 feet, I flipped it into RTL, it when up a good 60 feet, passing its 45 foot parameter height. The barometer came to mind, might be off because it was windy.  I tried RTL twice but it keep going higher and I discontinue that process.  As it continue to Yaw, I applied Yaw in the opposite direction to counteract the rotation to no effect.  Tried pitching forward in Loiter mode but that had little effect plus that would have only moved it further away from us.  AltHold work but it drifted with no stick control. When we did get it into Stabilize mode (had to update that mode through telemetry as we just removed it earlier) pitching forward had little effect and it started to drop down.  As it was going down it started to tumble, I flipped back into Loiter and that stopped the tumble. At this point I flipped it back to Stabilize, it made its way down through some 100 pine trees in a wooded area.

I checked the RPM of the motors with props individualy and the anti-clockwise motors are giving both 8000 - 8100 RPM at full throttle  while the clockwise ones are giving 7700 - 8000 RPM. I got a X Frame Quad.
293,Autotuned PIDs working less well than default PIDs,3,"Hi all !

I think there are a couple of possibilities:  there’s a hardware issue with the eeprom which is making the firmware think the format of the eeprom is incorrect and must be formatted.  If it’s losing all calibration and returning to the “factory defaults” then I suspect this is this hardware issue. the GCS is writing some parameter values back to zero for some reason.  I’d recommend making sure the GCS is at the latest value.  Then we’d need to figure out which values are being overwritten and report it to the GCS developer via the appropriate issues list.  github.com/diydrones.  To figure out which params are being overwritten, could you store parameter files from before and after the problems occur?  I.e. store a param file now, then another the next time it loses it’s calibration. A the risk of appearing to pass the buck, I think the issue is most likely in the hardware or the GCS software rather than the fligthcode. "

307,Hurt alarm/warning,0,"With AP 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 after landing the copter could not be disarmed and the props continued spinning. Pressing the security button stoped the motors. In order to check the issue again, I pressed the security button again and immediatly all motors started with full power. ( with 60 A ,3 times more than hovering) The copter jumped up an the left prop has hurt my little finger dramaticaly. The nerv is cut but the bone OK. I find that this is a really issue that pressing the security button does not disarme. e.g. mecanical tool machines don’t start again after power interruption.

308,Using Copter in Guided mode with non-periodic heading updates,0,"Hello, I have an application where I have to hover electrical power lines. In this situation, the compass is completely unusable. My strategy is to use computer vision to estimate the vehicle heading with respect to the cable and provide heading updates to the APM Copter position controller. However, during short periods of time (< 5 seconds) I may not be able to provide updates of the heading for various reasons (e.g. cable outside of the camera field of view). However, I would still like to use the Guided mode to control position (X/Y/Z) and stay over the cable. I need your experience to find answers to the following questions:  Is it the good forum to post this question? For this short period of time without heading updates, do you expect a large drift on the heading? Does this drift would be too significant and make the Guided mode unusable? Is there any failsafe that I should take care to tolerate sporadic “compass lost”?  Thank you very much, Philippe",

310,HELP. Ublox Neo 6m Not locking on the GPS,0,"Good day folks. Did a test flight this morning and noticed I was losing GPS signal. Discovered that my “GPS” port was a little lose as the green light in the GPS went dead and then would come on when wiggling the port. Confirmed is was not the wire or the white plug. Opened the pixhawk and glued the jack port in place. Plugged the Ublox in again and power stayed on. Now the green light is on and the Blue gps light blinks but it will simply not get a gps lock. Decided to configure the ser4/5 port as GPS and still the same result. Green power light on, Blue GPS light blinking but no GPS lock after 20 minutes. Any suggestions?",

","Can you upload you log file somewhere else, I cannot download it from that site. Assuming you are running a 4S battery, then 12.8 is a critically low voltage. Once Lipo’s reach about 3.2 volts per cell they start loosing power VERY fast.  As a rule of thumb, set your fail safe voltage to 3.4 volts per cell if you are flying nearby to avoid losing power and damaging your batteries.  Set it higher if you are flying far away from your home location as it will take some time to get home. I suspect that at 12.5V your battery could not supply enough power to fight the wind.  BTW, if you really mean 13 m/s then that is VERY VERY high wind for any quadcopter to be operating in.  That is nearly 30 miles per hour.  I am impressed it stayed in the air for 22 minutes! Using mission planner you should be able to see when a failsafe was activated using the review log function.

312,Motor clipping in flight,0,"We have a heavy X8 that is having a hard time handling high wind conditions.  During loiter in place, it does fine, but when we change flight modes or change position, the wind seems to have more of an influence, causing it to pitch or roll excessively.  It seems once the pitch or roll axes exceeds about 75 degrees, the motors begin to clip (I supposed in an attempt to correct it) and it cannot correct and eventually crashes. My question, should the motors EVER clip, even during these extreme wind circumstances or is this a sign that our system is underpowered?",

316,Seeking tips to Loiter-tune a *really heavy* single-rotor model,0,"Dear community, I have a very heavy single-rotor heli (MTOW ~ 25 kg / 55 lb) with a PixHawk currently loaded with ArduCopter 3.2.1, but that I tentatively plan on updating to the latest stable 3.3.x release. It currently flies well in Stabilize, but disastrously in Loiter. It’s a long story, but in a nutshell, over the course of some time, several people that weren’t properly communicating with each other or following proper procedures messed around with the flight parameters, to the point where I have little to no idea where to even begin making adjustments. The other extremely important thing to note is that when this beast of a helicopter crashes, it crashes hard and requires costly repairs, so it is very nerve-racking to test-fly, switching it into Loiter basically amounts to a leap of faith, and engaging in “casual” trial and error is simply not an option. If anyone who’s knowledgeable and interested would like to take a look at the current parameter file and indicate if anything jumps out that seems wildly unusual and potentially the source of the problem, please let me know and I will PM you to arrange to send you the file. OR alternatively, I can list the values of specific parameters, as requested, in this thread, which might actually be better to encourage teamwork than privately sending the parameter file to separate individuals. Again, it flies very satisfactorily in Stabilize, so I’m not interested in changing those parameters. I figure most likely something is off with the Alt Hold and/or Loiter-specific parameters, or possibly GPS or compass parameters. What I can tell you is that the model immediately crashed the last 2 times it was switched into Loiter. The first time, some major oscillation was evident for the first second or two in Loiter mode, which most likely put too much stress on the mechanical components of the rotorhead (e.g. servos, ball links, etc.) of this very heavy machine and caused it to mechanically fail. I’m unfortunately not sure whether or not any parameters were changed in between this crash and the next attempt to switch it into Loiter. The second time though, it immediately seemed to just flip on its side, consequently lose all of its lift, and go down sideways. Sorry this case is a bit convoluted and probably lacking as much information as would ideally be required, but I would be most appreciative of any feedback that could help get this model flying properly in Loiter, and ultimately in Auto/WPNav mode. Cheers, undermedia",
317,Chanel management,0,"Hi there  I just scratched the surface of copter 3.3, but I can’t seem to find a way to have multiple flight mode to the channel 7 to 12, like what is possible with the channel 5, where different PMW values assign different flight mode. On the 5th channel, I tried to mix two switches or thinking about modifying my Taranis to get a 6 positions switch, but I don’t find those solutions ergonomic. I also would like to know, if it’s possible tu use my CH15 and 16 to modify my flight mode or turning on/off my lidar for exemple. Thanks Ben",
318,Won't track ROI,1,"Hey guys, Just started working with a drone and it requires the drone to be pointed toward the middle of a circle for the duration of flight.  After reading through the wiki it seems that setting a range of interest is what I want, however when I set the range of interest after my first waypoint the drone seems to just disregard the command.  I have tried multiple times and after watching many videos and reading many topics most people state it is a simple as adding the ROI and it will follow until you add another ROI with all settings to zero. Also, as an aside, I have set the WP_YAW_BEHAVIOR to 1 as mentioned on several other boards. Thanks, Chris",I have good news and bad news after a bit more testing.  I have finally got the drone to rotate according to the ROI (had to turn the gimbal type to none) which leaves me with one more of a pickle.  I have a servo type gimbal on the drone and once ROI is set it looks directly at the ground.  I read on the wiki that the ROI altitude is meters above home so I set it to 10 which should make it look at least mostly straight out of the front if I am flying at 30 ft.  Do you have to do some type of gimbal calibration or are there some settings that might help me out?
319,Takeoff speed in guided/auto,0,"Hi, I had a situation today where I tried auto-takeoff and the drone took off too slow and got caught by the wind. When flying in wind using the RC transmitter I “bump” the throttle to get the quad clear of the ground as quickly as possible. How can I do this in auto mode? Is it the WPNAV_SPEED_UP which controls the vertical velocity at takeoff? I’d simply like the quad to rev up the motors at bit more aggressively to clear ground.",
320,Iris rocket Sudden vibrations triggered from battery failsafe (Audio resonance?),1,"Hello guys, I was flying my IRIS quad on Loiter today when a battery failsafe triggered and the quad went into RTL mode as configured.

At first flight attempt, in Stabilize mode, I’ve been able to just lift it of 1 cm. (yes, actually not lifted) because the X6 starts to slowly yaw counterclockwise. The yaw stick from the radio TX does NOT control yaw, despite the radio is calibrated and it correctly reports its values on the APM Planner on my Mac (connected with SIK V2 telemetry radio to the copter). I tried to use Loiter mode, and the copter flipped backwards upside down. I remember to have checked the motors wiring according to Ardupilot Wiki, will double check today. Anyway, what could be the problem? Another strange behaviour is that APM Planner reports me FCU errors randomly: bad accel health, for instance, but if I power cycle the copter, it disappears. Any help would be very very appreciated. Thanks.",If you can get the log off the copter and post a link from google drive or one drive we can see what was going on.

The setup is:  3DR Pixhawk with APM 3.3.3 Tarot X6 960 frame Tarot 5008 motors 18x55 CF props T-Motor 40A ESCs UBlox M8N GNSS external GPS FrSKY X9D+ and X8R receiver 10A Tattu 25C LiPo  Everything has been calibrated, from ESC to Radio. At first flight attempt, in Stabilize mode, I’ve been able to just lift it of 1 cm. (yes, actually not lifted) because the X6 starts to slowly yaw counterclockwise. The yaw stick from the radio TX does NOT control yaw, despite the radio is calibrated and it correctly reports its values on the APM Planner on my Mac (connected with SIK V2 telemetry radio to the copter). I tried to use Loiter mode, and the copter flipped backwards upside down. I remember to have checked the motors wiring according to Ardupilot Wiki, will double check today.

I would follow the instructions on the following page to reset your PID’s to something that should fly. You can also save them on the advanced tab prior to resetting them. You will also need to re-due all the setup calibrations again as well.

332,Delayed trigger RC failsafe,3,"Is there a way to delay the trigger for rc failsafe? for example 5 seconds or so, then it trigger the failsafe. I didn’t find anything about it",I see.  But this dangerous since a lot can happen in 5 seconds if your radio connection is actually lost.  Probably why the delay is either not visible or not implemented. Take a look at the full Parm list. * Or you could just disable fail safe if your just testing. This will let you continue troubleshooting.
332,Delayed trigger RC failsafe,4,"Is there a way to delay the trigger for rc failsafe? for example 5 seconds or so, then it trigger the failsafe. I didn’t find anything about it","I would have liked to see this option on AC3.2. My friend’s tricopter can have a momentary signal drop, only tenth’s or even hundred’s of a second but enough to trigger the rc failsafe. A delay of maybe 1-2 second’s would solve this problem for him, though changing from a ****** Spektrum DX7 gen 2 would probably help as much. The fixed antenna is a really **** design and we’ve proved it’s orientation directly effect’s the range at which these signal drop’s happen. Plane has short and long term failsafe’s, something similar for Copter (3.2 as he has an APM) would be nice."

","For what it’s worth I had an eerily similar crash with 3.2.1 last year. Forgot all about it until seeing this thread… No complaints here, but I thought I’d pass it along in case it can be of help. A bad motor mount broke mid-flight, I instinctually dropped the throttle, then went back to full, but it didn’t fully recover and spun to the ground in a few seconds. I only broke one arm and a landing leg as it didn’t drop out of the sky. That particular copter had a 2.5 : 1 thrust/weight ratio, so there should have been plenty of power to recover if it was supposed to. I don’t have video of the crash, but you can see a video of the issue that eventually caused it here: * The root problem with the copter was “vibration isolating” motor mounts that would resonate at a certain throttle range… amplified by carbon tubes that were too long and thin flexing under the load. The motors were fine, I went on to use them in another build that worked flawlessly. Here is the log:  *"

","My thought is to – avoid - the prop failure itself. Started into multirotors, with the plastic $1-$2 props.   After two failures (like yours) and a thirt failure with a bird sucked into the prop. I decided the root issue is the plastic props.   Since then (on my two Quads & two Hexes)  I’ve ONLY used the $4 carbon-fiber props.   (BTW:  be sure to balance them. No a single prop (plastic or carbon) has come balanced properly.) Since then, even with hard crashes (from learning manual flips), the Carbon Fiber props have outlasted many, MANY of the cheap plastic ones. BTW: The stiff/ridged carbon fiber props give the aircraft a very “crisp” flight feel.  (Since they don’t flex as they spin.) Jack"

There is some discussion here that would suggest that there is not yet any code, although one may get lucky (perhaps explaining the empirical evidence) if they don’t need yaw control: * … perhaps again explaining why cookmangr and myself experience mild crashes after a rotor failure, since we both engaged yaw. … but it might be helpful if someone with real knowledge could indicate either way."

It does not look like many juxtaposed PWM signals. Each channel is separated from the next one by what you see as a dip in the voltage. Actually, that should be a low level lasting 300us if I remember right. What is the low time of each short pulse? It is not clear in your picture, but it is not impossible that it lasts about that long. So, concluding, I would say that in second glance, I don’t see anything wrong with this PPM frame."

When you switch modes the copter will stop climbing and the real air pressure will be seen causing it to level off and the altitude to increase as shown. Also you may have to tune your dead zone when switching between Stabilize and Alt-hold or Position-hold based on how powerful your copter is. Mike

Yeah we re-examined the drone today and found out that the front right motor is not working correctly. One of the copper windings is cut off on the inside. But our theory is that this was mostly because of the crash since the drone crashed hard on this side of motor/propeller. The motor also came out of the motor mount and this was mostly because the propeller kept spinning after crash and took the motor out by force. Here’s the link to the pic of the motor: * But do you think there could be a possibility that the motor copper winding was screwed up during the flight itself? I cannot find anything to blame the Pixhawk from the logs since the Pixhawk was reportedly doing the job correctly.

There is an expensive camera on board that we dont want to hurt. Switching to Naza would give us some reliability I believe but it would become an entirely closed system then with little room for writing obstacle avoidance software and other interfaces. Or should we test the craft with Naza first completely and then switch back to Pixhawk. One of the main features that Naza doesn’t have and the reason that we are using Pixhawk is the CAM_TRIGGER. Plus DJI has included a lot of no flying zones in their latest firmware for autonomous flight. Any recommendations?

It’s clearly a hardware problem with either the ESC, the motor, or the electrical (PWM) signal going to the motor. ( eg, if the plug to that ESC got shook loose ).    any of these would give identical symptoms.  however, it’s easy to test post-landing… check if ESC is 100% , and it’s one of the other two.   check if the esc wiring is reliable and plugged in right, and then the only other option is the motor itself… and since that was damaged on landing, you’ve gotta replace it anyway.

Folks have documented previous unsync issues but I don’t understand it too well to explain here. Any thoughts? Or should we just replace the motor and give Pixhawk another try. The ESCs are good. Could this in remotest sense have anything to do with the fact that the Pixhawk servo rail is not powered? If its not powered, how does the 3.3V PWM signal go to the ESCs? Could this non-powering of the servo rail lead to any noise on the PWM signal sent to the ESCs?"

Anyway, your problem was not related to “servo rail power” as the other 3 motors continues to attempt to control the copter on the way down… so the pixhawk and other 3 escs were all operational.    That’s not the problem.      If it was me, and everything else tested fine except the one motor, I’d get a replacement motor, triple check all the wiring, and try it again, but this time hover lower, and over long grass… as then your less likely to destroy stuff if something else goes wrong.   best of luck."

Also +1 on flying the machine manually at low level. I never add a camera to fixed wing or rotary platforms until I learn to trust them. Generally around 5 hours of flying for fixed wing, little less for rotary. Also having less stuff connected gets rid of any potential interference from them."

Pictures of Drone:     [15 new photos · Album by Karan Kamdar] 1MW Pixhawk Drone     ","Hi Guys, I got a reply from the DIYDrones post on the same issue. Its as below: “I would check motor/ESC #1 for damage and function.  From the log the autopilot throttle up motor #1 and throttled down #2, motors #3 and #4 mirrored eachother.  This is consistent with motor #1 failing. If no physical damage is seen (scorched wires, broken wires, bad smell) then what might have happened is a motor/ESC sync problem.  Reducing PID values to “detune” the quadcopter can help keep the motors from losing sync in some circumstances.” Would any of you happen to shed some more light on the motor/ESC sync problem? I have absolutely no knowledge about this issue and does this issue imply some kind of a compatibility issue of ESCs with Pixhawk or is it purely between the ESCs and motor?(since it seems to me from the log that the PWM pulses were being sent out ok from the Pixhawk). Is there a way to figure out the ESC/motor sync problem from the logs? And finally how does reducing the PIDs help is improving the sync?"

These are NO BEC ESCs and each of their signal-ground servo connectors is connected to the respective motor output pin on the Pixhawk servo rail. Nothing else is powering the Pixhawk servo rail. The X8R SBUS is connected to the RCIN port of the Pixhawk. Finally there is one signal wire that is connected to a GoPro Camera (which is supplied power through a BEC) on one of the Pixhawk AUX ports so that we can utilize the Camera Trigger functionality of Pixhawk. Finally a 5.8 Ghz Transmitter with an 11Dbi Antenna is powered from the PDB and its connected to the video output of the GoPro. No gimbal is connected.

Having had a lot of them with large, slow motors they always presented themselves with rapid changes like stabbing the throttle or flying in blustery conditions. Your heli was doing a nice slow decent when it happened. Conditions look calm too. I would change all cables on that arm. I’ve had a servo wire which had a bad crimp. A few crashes later I found it when I pulled on the wire and it came apart."
348,PX4 Optical Flow Kit errors,0,"Hello. I have a HobbyKings S500 QUADCOPTER and just brought a PX4 Optical Flow Kit and i encounter some problems with it. This is the product : * I am using ArduCopter 3.3 (don’t know what RC, maybe the lastest) I encounter a dozens of problems :   When i am running the DRONE from the battery i see no optical flow in dataflash logs at all.   When i am running the DRONE from the battery sometimes i see BAD GYRO HEALTH error and can’t ARM because of this, sometimes not.   When i am running from USB, i can see OF logs in dataflash logs, but the EKF5.meaRng is just a flat line, even though i change the height of the drone, i see nothing. If the sonar was working i should see a more precise ALTITUDE, right?   When i am running from USB, i see “Bad LiDAR Health” and in QgroundController i see “pre arm check range finder” errors   DATAFASH LOG 1 (when i have the usb connected) * DATAFLASH LOG 2 (when i give current from the battery) * I also had to change FLOW_ORIENT_YAW from 0 to -9000 in order to calibrate the sensor. I have updated the firmware of PX4FLOW using the px4flow-klt-06Dec2014.px4 file (found here *) where some says that is the best. How it looks like now when running from USB : [IMG1] IMU.GyrX with FlowX and BodyX *  [IMG2] IMU.GyrY with FlowY and BodyY *  [IMG3] EFK5.meaRng *  Other images :       [Album] PX4 Optical Flow kit      The dataflash logs are just tests, i was not flying drone, just moving it around from hand.

At the moment, it is either or: using GPS will not allow the use of a flow camera and vice versa. This is bad, as with GPS the flow camera ( PX4FLow) could provide redundancy, e.g. when GPS is lost. In the PX4 flight stack, the data from the PX4 Flow camera is fused with GPS data, but in Ardupilot it is not.

367,PixHawk freezes when trying to calibrate roll,0,Copter V3.3.3 Mission Planner 1.3.35 Genuine 3DR PixHawk FrSky X9E At least I think the PixHawk is frozen. The LED goes to solid yellow and information in mission planner stops being updated. I’m pretty sure V3.3.2 worked properly but V3.3.3 isn’t working for me now. I recently had a problem trying to go into autotune so I tried it again on the bench. It won’t go in via either flight mode or ch 7/8 option.  So decided to wipe the PixHawk and start over. First I installed tracker then Copter 3.3.3. As I was re-doing all my configuration going through radio calibration The PixHawk frose. All the channels except roll worked fine. The other sticks have the same end points as roll. I installed 3.2.1 and that version works fine. Autotune does not cause an error and proper indication is in HUD. Radio roll calibration works fine. No Pixhawk lockup. I could find no log indicating the hang at the end but I’m not sure what to look for actually. Probably doesn’t matter because I haven’t been able to upload logs anyways.,

Particularly in the calibration of the radio and direction of prop rotation. Is you battery new? Has it been handled well (not left to discharge too much) So many questions so little time! The AMA must have made the correct hardware choices so it must be something simple.

369,Can ardupilot do this mission? (max climbing speed etc.),1,"We need to control the copter with a programmed mission, for a particular work. Can you tell me if, with ardupilot, I could achieve this? It seems that with DJI products i can not do the following: -The mission shall program the copter to move between the waypoints with a vertical climbing speed of 8m/s. -each waypoint shall be reached with the minimum time, reducing the time for the positioning on each waypoint (no need for smooth movements) -the mission shall consist of up to 20 waypoints -the copter shall start the movement from a waypoint to the next after a programmed number of seconds elapsed from the launch of the mission, (on DJI products instead, the hold time is measured from the moment when the waypoint is reached, alter the stabilization phase ). All these requirements are needed in order to allow an external device, to detect the copter in a precise point in a precise moment. Could you reply with the following information for each required feature? -ability of ardupilot to satisfy the requested feature -parameter to set in order to achieve the feature (if known) -possible workaround (in case the feature is not supported)","climb rate is fully configurable, as long you have thrust needed, there is no problem. as for the timing relative to mission start, I am not so sure, ArduPilot can do timing relative to mission items and absolute time. but then you can command at at any time you like using a scripted GCS , or python + mavproxy, because the mavlink telemetry can do these things anyway."
370,RTL Motor Cutting Off,0,I have a Iris+ and just updated my firmware to 3.3.3. I flew if for the first time today and I noticed that when I move from Loiter to RTL (Return to Land) that it sounds like the motors cut off for a second. It is hard to tell if they are really cutting off or if it is changing speed as it changes modes. Is this normal or should I be worried?,
371,Pixhawk randomly spins yaw and motors dip speeds after 3 min,0,"I am not sure if both of these things should be in one topic, but I’m putting them together because they are possibly related. I put a Pixhawk running ArduCopter 3.3 on my homebuild H quad frame.  I set it up through MP with no problem, other than a small issue with the power module not measuring the battery correctly. The quad is powered by a tether supplying 11.3V @ 25 amps but it only pulls 5A nominal. I tried flying it today in stabilize and encountered two issues:  The yaw randomly will move left or right sometimes as much as 90 degrees. It is possible that the tether is moving it, but could someone please check that it’s not the software? I tried to trim it out, but it changes direction often. The only occurs some of the time though, so for 70% of the time it flies normally. At about 3:45 into the flight, my front right motor dipped in speed and the quad banked to about 45 degrees in both roll and pitch. I did a touch and go then brought it back into the air. Shortly thereafter, the front right motor dipped again, and this time it flipped over. An interesting note: The Pixhawk did not register the crash and I had to manually disarm. Is this a hardware problem or a software problem?  Diagnostic info from the quad: From the message tab in MP: PX4v2 00550030 31345104 32363834 Frame: QUAD PX4: 34e1d543 NuttX: 7c5ef883 APM:Copter V3.3.3 (acf2e10c) The bin file from the flight is too large to attach so here is the dropbox link: * Thanks, luketheduke",
372,First flight issues with 3.3.2,0,"I recently had a first flight with a 3dr 2014 quad frame and a pixhawk, the experience was a little drifty. Took it up for a few and saw it moving away from me and not really responding to the controls so I brought it down and it flipped over on tall soggy grass. No biggie everything checked out. I was reviewing the log files and noticed des roll and roll aren’t tracking anywhere near one another. And the same for pitch which would explain why I felt it wasn’t responding well. This is stock pids too. * * Any suggestions, could it be the radio?",
373,Unusual crash. Switching from RLT to Loiter,1,"After re-building our H8 and re-tuning it with autotune.  (previous post Autotune Crash) I had a few good flights.

However, we went out on a job today and decided to  to use this rig as it was best suited and is / was flying very well. After a few flights I got lazy and desired to do a RTL. The gig flew back very nicely and started to land. At this point I jumped over to to Loiter as it missed the home point and was going to land in a pond. As soon as I switched to Loiter the rig started to yaw clockwise and descend. I reacted by applying ccw yaw and waking the throttle full up. I got no response, the hely just continued to yaw CW and decent  into the pond, Unfortunately the camera was not recording at this point so no sound captured. I have looked at the log several times and my understanding of it is:- vibrations are low. * I bereave the vibrations are low typically between 0.4 and -0.4.

Tracking, looking at DesRoll vs Roll it was racking very well up until the point there it switcher to Loiter around 19.5 mins into the log. The then starts drifting  ever so slightly. * The point where is diverse off is when the Helli is lifter out of the water. Yaw:- You can see the Yaw at the switch over point. is basically starts spinning CW. * Now something funny here.

This is odd as as I remember it I commanded a CCW yaw to counter-act the CW yaw after it started yawing!!! Also the DesYaw is matching the Yaw! this is also strange. Altitude:- At 178938,1548 you can see I hit the throttle (Altitude) up to stop the heli from descending into the water. However you can see the altitude droops NOT fast but relatively slowly and is matching DAlt. So it os clear that the NAV is wanting the hely to decent. Question is why??? * As for the battery, i’m not sure which data in the log to look at. but they were at 73% when I checked after the crash… [b] So two issues, is the system miss decoding the Yaw commands?

Pixhawk Log:- * Tlog:- * Thanks Anthony","OK Yaw again, looking at the log again I think the Yaw command from me was a bit misleading, well to me it was. The Yaw command input stopped for quite some time whilst is was still yawing CW. I do distinctly remember trying to counteract the yawing and stopped as it made no difference. I stopped the input at 179150 and the yawing continued on until 180845 at which point the rig hit the water. I am still confused as the desired yaw and altitude is wanting the heli to yaw and descend! Is this some sort of fail-safe kicking in?? or the APM trying to save the heli from complacently falling out the sky? Just as a note, I have tested this rig with 4 out of the 8 motors dead and it still flies well. So I presume if even up to 4 ESCs / motors failed it would still be controllable and land-able… IM *"

Any help appreciated.",I think that 3.3 requires a better lock than previous versions and that the GPS and MP wioll both report 3D Fix before the EKF is truly happy. What is the Sat count?  I now yuou have 3D Lock but… The warning you got on the MP screen happens when the GPS lock is not accurate enough.  I have been working aroung this by enabling the fence which seems to make the LED indicator  wait until the EKF is happy and set its Origin before turning green (in all modes). I think it is the same as trying to arm in a GPS mode such as Loiter or POSHOLD etc. Once the GPS has a good enough lock it will arm without problem.  I think that the main LED also reports properly with the fence on as it does not turn green until it is happy. I have been unable to get a good enough lock without SBAS (show SBAS with fast flashing greeen LED) Randy describes it beeter in the 3.3 Beta Test thread but to solve your issue make sure that you have more than 8 Sats and try enabling the fence.  You could also try raising the good  HDOP value by a very small amount.  I think the new default is 1.4.  Just be careful not to raise it too much! Hope that helps.

So confused… Am i doing something wrong?? Thanks Josh
378,Problem Uploading firmware from MAC,7,Hey! I have been trying to upload the quadcopter firmware from my macbook to the Arducopter and i keep having problems… It keeps telling me “Unable to open Com port: usbmodem1411” can you please help me. the lights turn on when i plug in the arducopterand everything. when i download the mission planner. when i click it to run it tells me that 'There is no application set to open the document “MissionPlanner-latest.msi” ’ DO you think that is the problem? PLease let me know if you can help!!! Josh,i think you have to install the drivers package still

387,Pixhawk Sets Crash Bit and Disarms in Flight Help!,1,"Hey All, Hoping for a little help here. I had an interesting mishap the other day.  I have a Quanum 680UC Pro Hexa-Copter from HK, running the latest version of APM Copter (V3.3.2 I believe) on a Pixhawk.  I’ve been struggling with getting the PIDs where I like them.  I’ve run Autotune a few times, but never really happy with the results.  I have a buddy with the exact same setup, and he has had much better luck than I have.  I think there may be a flaw in my assembly or I got a wonky Pixhawk. Anyway, I had reset the PIDs to the “stock” 3DR default settings, and had flown a ~8 min flight in Stabilize mode.  I was pretty comfortable with the copter behavior, so I hooked up a fresh battery and programmed an Auto mission to the local school and back (the school is at the end of my street).  On the return leg the aircraft was fighting itself a little in pitch.  Suddenly while doing 14 knots at 125’ AGL Mission Planner reports “Crash - Disarming” as I watch the front rotor spin down and the copter roll over and head to the ground before losing video. Fortunately I was running the video through an EzCap to my laptop and recording the video on the Mission Planner HUD.  The transmitted video was getting a little weak as the copter made the turn towards home, but you can clearly see what happened.   * Looking at the log files, I can see a bit of Pilot Induced Oscillation (PIO) from the Pixhawk, but the pitch excursions didn’t go beyond 25° or so.  I really don’t know why APM Copter set the “crash” bit and disarmed in flight.  I thought there was protections in place to prevent this. Well, to finish the story, I ran up the road to find my copter upside down in the gravel parking lot you can see in the video,  It landed almost perfectly upside down, smashing my GPS mast, FrSky Rx, arm switch and top Pixhawk plate (borrowed from a 3DR Quad kit).  The Pixhawk survived, and once I disconnected all the wiring it would boot on the USB cable.  I think this Pixhawk is going into an Antenna Tracker project next, because I’m not sure I trust it.  The airframe looks to be OK, but I’ll disassemble the body plates before replacing the Pixhawk.  The motor and props look a little scratched but undamaged since they were not producing any power upon impact. Anyone have any ideas on why it “crashed” in flight?","rlog is only tlog + some mission planner stuff, not useful for analysis. Post .bin from pixhawk.

390,Traditional heli violent oscillations in alt hold mode,1,"Hi all, I had just gotten my traditional heli running missions when I dumb-thumbed it and disarmed mid flight instead of swiching modes (ch8 switch was right next to my mode switches) causing the heli to fall about 15m - I had enough control to get it on it’s skids but I destroyed the boom and chewed out all the helical gears that drive the tail.  I fixed the major damage done to the heli yesterday and took it for a test flight about an hour after the crash. I ran it successfully in alt hold, loiter and did a quick mission with auto take-off and land without issue.

390,Traditional heli violent oscillations in alt hold mode,2,"Hi all, I had just gotten my traditional heli running missions when I dumb-thumbed it and disarmed mid flight instead of swiching modes (ch8 switch was right next to my mode switches) causing the heli to fall about 15m - I had enough control to get it on it’s skids but I destroyed the boom and chewed out all the helical gears that drive the tail.  I fixed the major damage done to the heli yesterday and took it for a test flight about an hour after the crash. I ran it successfully in alt hold, loiter and did a quick mission with auto take-off and land without issue.

It seems the issue is directly related to the throttle I set- prior to my crash I had it set at 85% but I re-calibrated the radio and forgot to reset this- when the issue started the throttle was at ~105%.  I’ve been playing with this today and the maximum throttle I can set and get some alt stability is ~87% but it runs best at about 80%. I’m guessing that there is some negative pressure right where I have mounted the pixhawk?? Not sure what the best way to beat this issue is - maybe I should mount the pixhawk on it’s side. -Weird thing is that the baro data doesn’t look noise during oscillations (see attached). My pixhawk is mounted pretty much directly under the main shaft about 20cm below the rotors. Any pointers appreciated. pics * * *"
391,"Experiencing uncertainty with regard to ""Firmware Update"" MP",0,"I now have my second CX20 having done major damage to my first one. Apart from structural damage, landing skids, props and both shells I had one major screw up which (perhaps unfairly) I place at the door of MP. Somewhere (and I can no longer remember where) I read that the firmware on the autopilot should not be updated due to the differences in manufacture of some models and by doing so could render the quad unusable and yet the first screen on Initial Setup indicates that it is going to do just that (see jpg attached). Also under the tab “Initial Setup” there are 3 options: Install Firmware, Wizard, and Optional Hardware. I chose Install firmware and that was perhaps where I went wrong, from that point on I got continual beeping with no stopping it short of unplugging the USB, I realise that I should have chosen “Wizard”.  I believe that at that point I bricked the control board. What is the difference between that selection and the one on the first page of Initial Setup?  If I allow the programme to update the firmware on the board am I not going to “brick” my second CX20?  I believe too that the flight controller model differs from model to model viz: Quanum Nova and Cheerson and a third one whose name I can’t remember. I have asked this question on a number of boards and perhaps even this one and  have never yet received an answer with enough detail to satisfy a rank beginner in drone flying.  Essentially should I stick to a manual programming of my machine or risk another brick with MP? Any and all advice will be appreciated and acknowledged.  Regards Ewen Bogle",

Interesting considering Pixhawk only has 1 on board compass and the GPS based compass is not plugged in. My guess and I will confirm this tonight that the internal compass id has been somehow captured as the internal and external compass and this is causing the grief I am experiencing. IF I can I will reflash it tonight with a back leveled version of the code to see if it clears the issue.

400,Pixhawk: how to ensure waypoint alt is reached?,1,"Hi guys… I fly in mountainous terrain in New Mexico. I’d like to ensure that my F550 reaches a waypoint altitude before moving on to the next waypoint (more important of course flying UP along rising terrain than the other way around). Couple questions:   Does the Pixhawk do this by default?  Perhaps adjusting horizontal speed between waypoints so as to reach the next waypoint’s altitude at the same time the next waypoint is reached horizontally?  (Seems to be a reasonable safety precaution.)   If not, how can I program a flight plan so as to guarantee reaching the next waypoint altitude before moving on?   Thanks… – Bill","Hi wsalopek, My experience is primarily with Arduplane, so the parameters I’m pointing out are for that build. I’ll take a look later (or a copter person can pop in) and see if I can find the counterparts for Copter. These parameters (for plane) enable terrain following, which will mean your waypoint altitude will be AGL, or as close as can be estimated by your map data. I spent awhile looking for a parameter that I thought existed, which dealt with requiring a certain altitude before a waypoint could be marked as completed. Couldn’t find it, maybe I’m mistaken and was thinking of loiter to alt. I hope this helps a bit. * This enables terrain following for CRUISE mode, FBWB mode, RTL and for rally points. To use this option you also need to set TERRAIN_ENABLE to 1, which enables terrain data fetching from the GCS, and you need to have a GCS that supports sending terrain data to the aircraft. When terrain following is enabled then CRUISE and FBWB mode will hold height above terrain rather than height above home. In RTL the return to launch altitude will be considered to be a height above the terrain. Rally point altitudes will be taken as height above the terrain. This option does not affect mission items, which have a per-waypoint flag for whether they are height above home or height above the terrain. To use terrain following missions you need a ground station which can set the waypoint type to be a terrain height waypoint when creating the mission. * * enable terrain data. This enables the vehicle storing a database of terrain data on the SD card. The terrain data is requested from the ground station as needed, and stored for later use on the SD card. To be useful the ground station must support TERRAIN_REQUEST messages and have access to a terrain database, such as the SRTM database. * * This controls how far ahead the terrain following code looks to ensure it stays above upcoming terrain. A value of zero means no lookahead, so the controller will track only the terrain directly below the aircraft. The lookahead will never extend beyond the next waypoint when in AUTO mode. *"

401,Compass Help with new quad frame,1,"[attachment=0]20160118_172907.jpg[/attachment]Hi guys! I recently designed and built a new quad frame. It is a standard style carbon fiber plate folding quadcopter. I built this one to be large enough that i can stow the flight controller inside the plates. I had it on top before and always had to worry about bumping it. I took a maiden flight today and it flew well. I then broke it down and put it in its box for a little bit to move to a different location. When I pulled it out of the box and tried to fly, it wouldn’t take off due to compass inconsistency. Best I can tell, the gps/compass combo got bumped and threw things off. This happened with the GPS/Compass on a folding mast that was roughly 4 inches tall. In order to make everything more compact and less likely to get bumped, I pulled the GPS from the mast and stuck it directly to the top plate. I redid the compass calibration but it now has huge z axis offsets. Does anyone know if the new high offsets are caused by interference from the frame, or from proximity to the flight controller which is right under the gps inside the frame? Does anyone know if there is anything that could be done to retain the gps location but reduce the compass offsets?","Anyone with insight? If this should be posted elsewhere, please let me know."

I’ve done my own analysis and also asked at DIY drones first but there is no reply. Posted in the wrong forum, should go to “Log files, Tuning, and Analysis of Log files”. Sorry - help? Problem: My DIY H-frame Quadcopter in Auto or RTL suddenly veers off course / seems to lose control / bumbles through the air for about 1 or 2 seconds before I switch to Stabilize and land it manually. I’m attaching a log file where this happens (Auto -> Stabilize) around line 282.000. The second occurrence is later, where I switch from RLT to Stabilize. For the first event I’ve looked at the topics listed in * but could not find much. The DesPitch vs. Pitch, DesRoll vs. Roll and DesYaw vs. Yaw seem to show the course deviation but I can’t identify a reason:  EKF4.SMX/Y/Z are all normal (below 0.1) at that time IMU.AccX/Y/Z are oscillating between  -1.1 and -2.0 (X), 0.2 and -0.8 (Y), -8 and -11 (Z) (not a vibration issue) MAG.MagX/Z show bumps which may well be caused by the course change and not the other way around GPS.HDop is at 0.83 until after the switch to Stabilize (not a GPS issue) CURR.Vcc/Volt are normal as well (no brown-out) All motors, ESCs and batteries are cold to the touch right after emergency landing. In both cases the event occurs while the copter is supposed to fly a straight line. It looks as if it’s hit by a strong gust of wind - but it’s not, I’m fairly sure of that. The wind was blowing only slightly and from the other direction.  Any ideas?? Thanks in advance!

405,ESC no longer function,0,I did a calibration on one of my quads using mission planner to initiate it.  After trying to spin up the motors only one worked and on the non working ones I just hear a faint tick-tick-tick sound.

Also I connected a programming card to the ESC’s and for the non working ones it won’t show any values. I have another copter with the same ESC\motors models.  I needed to run a calibration on that also so I decided to go with the original method which worked in the past.

Is it possible to program the UAV such that there is no pitching inputs on the UAV, however the tilting mechanism allows the UAV to fly forward. I removed the pitching inputs using my Flight Controller Futaba T8J and flew it using ALTHOLD mode, the UAV loses altitude as tilting occurs. Is there any better way around it? Thank you.",
412,GPS / serial errors on pixhawk,1,"I’ve been trying to get my pixhawk working with a basic ublox 6 GPS receiver. I get a good GPS lock when i am disarmed and on the ground. I can swap to GPS flight modes on the ground while disarmed and i get confirmation via the LED and also via my phone across bluetooth. As soon as i arm and take off all the GPS flight modes stop working. Here’s a log file with error messages; * I have reset everything to defaults several times, reflashed plane then copter firmware to ensure everything is wiped, no change in behavior. Here’s a screenshot of my terminal; * I am a little bit worried about the nonesense characters that are present. I get about 3 or 4 every few seconds that interupt my typing and prevent my using the terminal. I get the same nonsense characters via the terminal even with all serial devices including GPS and bluetooth removed. Have i broken my pixhawk somehow?",I have replaced the pixhawk and GPS unit and am getting the same errors. I cannot use any GPS flight modes anymore despite having set up the flight modes and gone through the wizard (multiple times). If I am on the ground and disarmed I can enter GPS flight modes and get confirmation from my phone across bluetooth telemetry that the flight mode has engaged (it says ‘loiter’). As soon as I arm and spin up the motors if I try to enter the GPS flight modes I get a ‘Beebop’ noise from the pixhawk speaker and no confirmation across bluetooth on my phone. Altitude hold and stabilise flight modes work fine but I cannot get any of the GPS flight modes to engage. Is it actually possible to enter a GPS flight mode with the aircraft on the ground armed with the motors spinning but the props off in order to test? I haven’t got flying weather at the moment and if the answer is no i’ve just wasted the last week. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I could be doing wrong? I have rebuilt the aircraft and electronics multiple times with 2 different pixhawks and keep getting the same GPS error. Here’s another log file;

414,GND_ALT_OFFSET not working,0,I am currently having an issue with maintaining a constant altitude during long missions (30+ minutes) I always verify that I am near zero for my home altitude before starting a new mission. I often notice the quadcopter gradually  loose altitude as the mission progresses even though the HUD display shows the correct altitude except for the lidar which decreases alt over time. When I land it often says it is 1-3m above ground even though it has landed. Im pretty sure this has to do with the long duration of the flight and changing barometric pressure.According to other users on this forum a workaround this issue is done by chaning the GND_ALT_OFFSET in the PARAMS during flight. Except nothing happens once the new offset is uploaded. Is this a bug in the firmware? or am I just doing this wrong. -Ed,
415,Arducopter tunning param are dependable between modes or not,0,"When looking at the different parameters available to tune the copter, I see some related to acro mode, other for stabilize, waypoint (navigation) … .  The experience in other AP systems tells me that any flying mode assisted by sensors like barometer, GPS, Optical flow, compass (stabilize, position hold …) are basically sub-modes based on the main PID ones that corresponds to the less assisted flying mode (called Soprt or Acro in those autopilots) and those the sub-modes could have certain adjusts to tame the reactions for each tasks, but basically they are dependable of the main ones. From my point of view the less assisted mode in arducopter is the Acro mode. In the extended tunning screen there are options for tunning the  Stabilize mode, Loiter mode , and Rates but nothing about Acro mode values. That is why I´m lost as  they are only accesible from the Full parameter list/tree screens. I have no idea if arducopter works the same way, and considering that the unit I´m tunning now will never fly in acro mode, does it matter what kind of values have I settle in any of the acro parameter fields? ( Acro Roll and Pitch gain / Acro Yaw P gain / Acro Balance Roll / Acro Balance Pitch/ Acro Trainer / Acro Expo) Options: a) No, pixhawk will never read such values if Acro mode is not in use. Acro values are for acro flight mode and not used by any other flying mode. b) Yes, and the right way, beyond using the autotune process, is to fine tune the unit in acro mode and from that point start with the rest of parameters in the Extended Tunning screen. Any light about that? Thanks and have a nice day",
416,Pixhawk serial port config question,1,"Help, I’ve run out of serial ports!

According to this page and the marking on my pixhawk; * There is a 5 serial port that shares a plug with serial port no. 4. How do i configure and make use of this port? I want to add in a serial based brushless gimbal and I’d rather not have to fly without the secondary GPS if possible.",Don’t know why you need two GPS devices.  This is currently not recommended and can cause the copter to crash. Ports 4 and 5 share a plug so you will need to use a splitter cable to make it work. Mike

The issue is the desired roll and desired pitch for both cases were in line, vibrations were no issue, GPS on the second crash was excellent, and I can’t seem to find the issue. The only red flag on the first crash was the EKF Horizontal Variance was maxed out, however, the compass was not showing any errors. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Since I was getting some data through OPTICAL_FLOW.ground_distance in telemetry logs, I assumed the wiki was just outdated… I’m flying pretty small 250 quads indoors (major reason for not using GPS and relying on OF instead), so LZ-EZ4 should be good enough for me (I have SF02/F LiDAR as well, but it’s too bulky and heavy). I’ll see if I can use the readings from the sonar on PX4Flow in EKF. If it goes well, maybe I can expose this setting via MAVLink parameter so people have the option of turning it on or off from their GCS.

The motors want to be able to hover the copter at a decent altitude with the PWM at 1500. This is something we all should have spotted earlier on. On 6S with your 28X8.2 blades the top 4 motors at FULL power will generate 2.2Kg thrust. The lower 4 will generate around 1.8Kg thrust. All 8 motors running flat out in “Ideal conditions” will JUST about lift 16KG on a good day. this combination will just lift your 13KG but will not be able to maintain hover let alone stability. This is the Advantage of a phone call. After it you pick up much more relevant details and things start piecing together. T-Motor Flame 80A are designed for these motors and run up to 12S. MayTech 50A HV are cheaper and not too bad at all. KDE XF 75A HV are also very good. It’s not the current you are too concerned about its the voltage. Remember this copter should only pull about 35-40A in total. That’s 5A per motor.  Therefor a high voltage is what you are looking for. These motors and blades on 12S will pull 15A MAX no more.

426,3.3.2 firmware issue? Taranis firmware update issue?,1,"Intro … this past week I purchased the Craft/Sky telemetry module for the Taranis s.port at * This requires that the Taranis be using firmware 2.1.x (I had 2.0.9 on it because I didn’t see a reason to update until then) AND that a modified 3.3.2 firmware be loaded.  I understand from the owner of this design that he is currently working with the team to ensure that his modifications are included in the standard branches at some point. This may be something not related to the firmware modification on the FC…it could be any number of things. I had to update the firmware on the Taranis from 2.0. to 2.1. I love the telemetry module sofar, but something has happened in between updating the firmwares that I no longer have real alt hold control on the Pixhawk as I used to. I set the THR_DZ on the PX firmware to 100 previous to this, and it gave me a manageable deadzone in the throttle deflection where I could maintain altitude. Since updating that has gone away. Not sure if this is something on the Taranis, but it may be because I reverted my PX firmware for a bit back to what I was using AND to my saved parameter file and got the same issue. What I haven’t done is revert the Taranis back to the 2.0.x firmware. I know this module probably hasn’t sold a lot of units just yet, but have any of you out there seen this? I cannot get any Pixhawk mode to keep a stable altitude at all right now when in modes that utilize it. I can tell by looking at the CTUN.Dalt parameter on a graph pre and post update that something is amiss. On the graph pre update, I see nice, stable flat lines where I’m in the throttle deadzone. The new graph doesn’t give me that. Here is the graph pre update: * Now, here it is post update: * If needed I can provide a link to the last log which reflects the post update graph. Thanks for your help.","Never mind.  I found the problem after tearing out my (what’s left of it anyway) hair overnight and working on it today. I had put a sonar module on it for testing some time back, but could never get it to work.  It was still enabled in the firmware and somehow was providing readings to the FC.  Disabled it and voila…deadzone works again."

Many thanks for any help Gareth","Hi Gareth, It’s hard to answer your question on the ability to run higher rate gains without oscillation.  I had a quad which experienced the same thing.  It never really flew well on 3.2, probably because it had really high vibrations, which required very soft vibration isolators, which allowed the Pixhawk to move around a lot.  On 3.3, I found I was able to increase the gains about 2-3 times, and it flew much better.  I think it mainly has to do with some IMU filtering changes that went in for 3.3.  It’s allowed the Accel/Gyro data to filter out noise better, while still allowing control.  The oscillation you experienced with lower P-gains on 3.2 might have been due more to vibration, rather than just the capability of the airframe. Rob"

The 2nd IMU’s Y accel value is a bit noisy but that shouldn’t matter.  I see you’ve got the logging bitmask set as well so it’s logging while disarmed. In this case it doesn’t look like the accel calibration was being done.  The log is only 34 seconds long and the board is flat the whole time. Can I ask, when you do the accel calibration, you’re using the mission planner or AP2?  By the way, there’s no need to worry about the compass during the accel calibration, it won’t matter what’s done with it. So if you’re using the MP, you’re going to the Initial Setup >> Mandatory Hardware >> Accel Calibration screen and pushing just the top button right?  Then it asks you to hold the board in 6 different positions (flat, left, right, nose up, nose down, on it’s back) and then after all that it gives you a failure message? Is the message one of these two: “Insufficient accel range” “accel[0] not healthy” If you respond here, I’ll be quicker to pick it up from now on, promise!"

Many thanks for any help Gareth","This happens to me toe hen I try calibrating my Pixhawk accelerometers…  It worked once but now it won’t… It will skip a step and then fail. My Pixhawk is only about 2 months old and has about 12 flights on it.  I even updated the firmware to the newest after getting the new firmware message and that didn’t help either.  Another odd thing is if I connect to mission planner and then disconnect I won’t be able to connect again unless I power cycle Pixhawk. Also I can’t ever connect by picking Pixhawk on the com port. I have to select auto every time or it won’t connect…  Everything worked great in the beginning.  I think mission planner updated in the past 2 months but I can’t remember for sure. Clearly something happened…  I think the issue is with mission planner somehow, because my Pixhawk on my x8 copter works and flies great…  My only issues are when I try to use mission planner…  Andropilot on my android phone won’t always load the map for some reason also but everything else in the app works fine…  Any of he other apps wont work at all for some reason…  Pixhawk works and flies great but it seems all the computer programs and android apps are extremely buggy for some reason…  Aldo I’m using genuine 3dr Pixhawk and parts I’ve ordered from 3dr. Every great once and awhile Pixhawk won’t arm due to accelerometer mismatch according to the android app. That’s what initiated me trying to calibrate the accelerometers and finding out about mission planner skipping steps without me clicking on the button. I power cycled Pixhawk many times and kept getting the error. Then I just left it sit with the battery connected with the led flashing yellow and the android app saying accelerometer error for 3 or 4 minutes and all of a sudden it made a tone the led went green and it flew fine… No issues after that for awhile.  Then it happened again. Power cycling didn’t Help, I couldn’t calibrate the accelerometers due to mission planner skipping steps so I just parked the copter on the shelf. 3 days later I took it to go flying along with my laptop in case I needed to try using mission planner and it worked great again… I plugged in the battery for the first time in days and within 25 seconds I got a green led, it armed and flew fine. I ran about 6 batteries thru that x8 copter that day and not 1 issue. It worked every time I plugged in the battery and after the 1st flight I had Gps locks in 5 seconds and I was in the air in 10 seconds… So it’s real odd how I get these errors and then I park it and few days later it works great…  Mission planner won’t though…  Nothing I do will allow the accelerometer calibrating to work. It just keeps skipping a next step without me clicking next and then failing. I can’t ever connect to mp unless I set it to auto and once I disconnect I can’t ever reconnect without power cycling Pixhawk… If anyone can help please do…  I just want to enjoy this stuff not fight and argue with it every time I want to use it ya know? -Mark"

I pulled the card, looked at a couple log files…a few wouldn’t open. I’m assuming crashes where the battery got disconnected abruptly… caused son formatting issues. After formatting the SD card in an external reader…I haven’t had the issue since. ymmv But it sounds like a legitimate reason for the MP to hang on you as well, just like any other 'puter waiting for some hardware to communicate."
428,What are people usually doing about high autotune P results?,1,"As we know, running Autotune results in high stab_P values. This makes the copter very sensitive pitch/roll/yaw inputs.

RC_FEEL as I understand it however, is how responsively the copter reacts to YOUR input, not the corrections of the flight controller. So what is too high, the reaction of the copter when left alone or when you’re moving the sticks? Too high P should result in slight oscillation, which often shows up first when hovering just in ground effect."

433,"Re-doing individual configurations in ""Initial Setup""",0,At the outset let me apologise if I am in the incorrect forum. I am both a newcomer to quad-copter flying and also to this forum so as you can see I have a steep learning curve ahead. I am using Mission Planner 1.3.33 build 1.1.5820.11240 I have a newly acquired CX-20 (Quanum Nova) and after battling to get it flying properly in the first instance searching the Internet soon put me onto Mission Planner.  Unhappily in the first tries I collided with a tree and damaged the upper shell and lost a propelled nut.  I have repaired the shell satisfactorily and I will probably be able to use the 'copter until a replacement shell arrives. In the interim I have used MP to set the 'copter up in readiness and although I passed through all 16 steps I am not sure that I have set the compass properly.  I would also like to reduce the take-off speed.  Previously the only way I could get into the air was to give it full throttle otherwise it just tipped over on it’s side. My question therefore is “can I redo individual steps of the setup procedure” or do I have to start again?  In the same vein can I reduce “take off” speed If this is possible can you describe the steps I should follow please?,

Since I’m fairly new to this, my guess it is something simple that I’m missing – if anyone can point out a solution for me it would be much appreciated!",*
435,Strange Crash,1,Hello to all Can someone analyze why my X* crashed i suspect problem in compass  and probably problem with internal compass,"Hello Antkon Besides your compass interference are high, I don’t think that was the cause. I would suspect that your PIDs aren’t adequate By the logfile , in the last few seconds, starting on line 48.5K it looks like the copter has wobbled hard on roll axis then a brownout occurred. Did the batteries got ejected ? How did you tune your PID parameters? Also your vibration levels are pretty high. I don’t think that was the cause either, but it could bring you problems. Could you describe what happened? Did you tape that?"

436,"[Indoor Flight] Looking for a solution for: IRIS+, DroneKit",1,"SPECIFICATION:  3DR IRIS+ ArduCopter 3.3.2 (Firmware Upgraded) DroneKit (2.0.2) MAVProxy (1.4.38) pymavlink (1.1.66) APM Planner 2.0.18 for Mac OS X  Hello, Pilots I am looking a solution or an insight for flying my 3DR IRIS+ INDOOR. My goal is to maneuver IRIS+ with Python function calls using DroneKit Using keyboard, I would like to mimic RC Controller. And eventually, these function calls are going to be used to control IRIS+ in X-Y-Z degrees, based on decisions made by a module, such as vision-based target following module. Due to circumstantial issue, I need to be able to take-off (up to about a 1~2 meters) maneuver all X-Y-Z axis and land, inside a high ceiling room, but without enough GPS signal. I’ve followed a few official documents: Indoor Flying Guidelines: * Pre-Arm Safety Check: * Guiding and Controlling Copter: * However, I couldn’t get enought help. I upgraded PIXHAWK Firmware to APM:Copter 3.3.2 From “Guiding and Controlling Copter”, using MAV_FRAME_BODY_OFFSET_NED seems to be helpful for controlling IRIS+ dynamically. But because this frame is available for only APM:Copter 3.3.2, I had to upgrade. Since upgrading, IRIS+ became more sensitive about PreArm Checking. Also, when it’s armed, the rotor are not rotating like before. I have to increase throttle speed from RC to see the drone taking-off. However, since my project is to develop a program to operate the drone, using RC shouldn’t be considered for any reason. Please help me to find a good solution to use IRIS+ using DroneKit programming more effectively, even being indoor circumstance. Thank you.","For indoor flight, there are a few options. we use Pixflow and works very well. We also use “Local GPS” this is a ultrasonic GPS system. Tale a look at the “Games on Track” system used for model railway. it uses the same system. Lidar scanner is a good option also. It is easier to implement then image recognition. image recognition, take a look at the “Red Balloon” DroneKit project . Processing power on board. After testing MANY options We went for the Odroid XU4 for many reasons. It’s fast, reliable and just works."

438,Setting up quadcopter with Taranis d4r-ii receiver,1,"I bought a pixhawk flight controller, a quadcopter frame/motor/ESC, Taranis x9d transmiter and d4r-ii receiver. When I connected the flight controller to APM via USB, the system says “RC not calibrated”.  Then I went ahead to calibrate the RC.  I selected “mode 2”, but the throttle becomes “roll” and other three stick controls jumbled no matter which mode I chose.  There was no way for me to make throttle as  the “throttle” on the APM planner screen. Also, no matter which button or dial on the tx I moved, there are no ways for me to effect the calibration on “radio 5” to “radio 8” on the radio calibration screen.  So after I made the calibration on the four channels on the main control sticks, I exit the RC calibration, but the system still says “RC not calibrated”. So what else do I need to do (on either or both the transmitter and the flight controller end) to properly assign channel and get RC calibrated? One more question: the quadcopter has four motors, how can I assign motor 1-4 to the pixhawk output?  which is the first output and is it run clockwise or anticlockwise?  These kind of things needs to be clearly documented in the frame selection user interface, or people will get it wrong.

My quad felt from 27m to the ground, destroying my gimbal. Further analysis revealed that the culprit was a multistar battery. One cell, besides apparently normal, under medium amperage ( around 25A ) suddenly drops the voltage to 0.5-1v. Without draw it remains “normal”. Not easy to detect until it happens.

I will definitely monitor each cells voltage under heavy load.  Yes I was only powering the Pixhawk through the power module. Which I now know only supports 60AMP current sensing with the Pixhawk and 90AMPs max. Attopilot 180 is on the way! Now I believe my hexacopter is capable of pulling close to 120AMPS at full power. Do you think that could have causd the module to fail temporarly? Also the dual pack setup is genius and will be applied before next takeoff. Voltage redundancy! Now the only question is two 8,000 packs or two 10,000? Thats a lot of battery lol. My goal is longevity while lifting a GoPro and gimbal. Thanks for your help tabascoz."

The behaviour of althold is fine . It is mean to be like that . I have never tried to play with my drone holding it with my hands , but maybe because of that the px4 is feeling that it isn’t necessary to maintain the thrust to keep the altitude,thus slowing down the motors .

For that , fly in a comfortable altitude that , if something should happens you could have enough room to recover by changing back to stabilize."

447,0% throttle stick results in throttle-mid motor speed,1,"I upgraded from 3.2 to 3.3 recently and had a near-flyaway crash immediately upon arming in Stabilize mode the 1st time after the upgrade. No problems with 3.2. All the standard recalibrations and preflight checks prior to 3.3 test flight. Today I rebuilt the quad and did some bench tests with the props off to figure out what happened. I discovered that in Stabilize with the throttle a ZERO - Pixhawk commands a throttle of 41% (my throttle-mid parameter). Just bumping the throttle up a hair results in the motors slowing down and spinning at the throttle-min (“70” or 7%). I changed the throttle-mid to “500” and sure enough, 0% stick position results in a motor speed output of “50%”. RC cal is fresh and correct. There is no expo or non-standard endpoints in my Futaba. Nothing changed on the quad or the RC controller between 3.2 and 3.3. But you can image that it was quite the surprise to arm the quad and have it take off with my throttle at ZERO. But again, bumping the throttle to >0 results in the expected throttle output. Any ideas?",Please post the log file

461,MP/ APM planner Connection to Pixhawk,0,"Hi all… I’ve been having a real time of it. (Pixhawk and 3.2.1FW) Having just returned from holiday and taken out my quad for a spin (previously working perfectly), I was rather irritated to find that I could not connect via the 3DR radio with my Android device, nor could I arm the Pixhawk, as there was no satelite fix (open playing field) and the OSD was receiving no telemetry at all. Having returned home in disgust, I tried without success to connect with MP. So I decided to reinstall the copter firmware having overwritten with plane 3.3.1. With firmware loaded, I then tried to connect and got failure after failure, mainly due to ‘Access denied to Com 1 port’. Despite the serial port showing  in the device manager, and working. So I tried clearing the port register using regedit, with little luck, and then tried connecting with APM planner, eventually succeeding, only by going the ""wizard’ route… This has all proved to be very tedious indeed, and I wonder why it should suddenly be so difficult to connect to the Pixhawk… Even on my laptop. Has anybody else suffered the same frustration? Any wisdom would be most welcome!. Best DP",

I think desPitch means “desired pitch” and is produced by the autopilot… why would the autopilot set this attitude? I thought perhaps the autopilot might be trying (incorrectly) to stop motion in the forward direction by pitching up abruptly, but IMU telemetry in the log doesn’t support that. Other ideas? vibrations seem “normal”.  RPY follow closely to desired RPY, so I don’t think there were any mechanical problems.  IMU & IMU2 seem to match closely.

The max value was slightly above 1500 and the min slightly below, no doubt caused by a slight perturbation when calibrating the aileron channel.  This made the heli hyper-sensitive to pitch input – and apparently resulted in A REVERSAL in forward/back behavior – which made the logs a bit more difficult to interpret.    After re-calibration of the radio, the heli flies fine."
463,Landing gear problem,1,"Hi, I’m new to the pixhawk and while I’m waiting for my props to arrive I decided to add electric landing gear. I have set channel 8 to landing gear and am using aux1 and have set RC_9_FUNCTION to 29. I can raise and lower the landing gear using channel 8 on the tx without any problem. PWM is 2000 for down and 990 for up. If I arm the copter and give it half throttle (no props on) and pick the copter up then select LAND on the mode switch then the landing gear RETRACTS the motors stop and the pixhawk disarms! If I do the same but raise the landing gear first then then select LAND then the gear stays retracted and again the motors stop and it disarms. Is this something to do with the way I’m testing or have I done something wrong? I tried setting RC_9_REV to -1 but it still does the same. Thanks in advance ","After reading a bit further I decided to try reversing the values in LGR_SERVO_RTRACT and LGR_SERVO_DEPLOY. This worked fine but meant I then had to reverse the channel in the Tx to make manual retraction work correctly. Anyway, its all OK now and my apologies for posting before checking properly."

Im not sure what the value of _fallback but either way it doesnt matter, if its false the test wont run so this test doesnt matter, if its true then the test would pass because ive checked the other values Test 3: Failed Test 3.1: So next tests run (if armed then Test3 as a whole passes) Quadcopter not armed so next tests run Test 3.2: Failed innovVelPos[5] = Log Review EKF3 - IPD = 1.4 (highest value, and this value is normally below 1 but spikes above every now and then) so this value value has gone above 1, so this test failed causing routine to return false (Unhealthy EFK, which is also Unhealthy AHRS “Bad AHRS”) Test 3.3: Passed innovVelPos[3] = Log Review EKF3 - IPN  = -0.08 (highest value) innovVelPos[4] = Log Review EKF3 - IPE  = -0.05 (matching row, but also the highest value) horizErrSq =  sq(-0.08) + sp(-0.05) -0.0089 =  -0.0064  + -0.0025 So -0.0089 is less than 1 so this test Passed Im modified the source below, ive only added comments"

Thanks Dennis,"Hi guys, Yeah, the Wiki was a bit out of sync with the actual program, I have gone ahead and updated it (might take a bit before you see the changes). There is no Auto mode for the landing gear. There is a ‘stub’ of it in the code but it doesn’t actually do anything yet.  For now, the middle position would just be neutral where, basically nothing happens. The reason Auto mode is not enabled, is because I haven’t figured out a good fool-proof way for that to work.  It should be possible to retract the gear automatically at a certain altitude (how high?) but automatic deployment is quite problematic.  Unless the copter has a rangefinder (sonar, lidar) we don’t really know how high we are above the ground at any point other than Home.  I am unlikely to create an auto mode unless I’m sure we have a good chance of it actually behaving reasonably well. Any ideas, I’m open. As noted in the Wiki, the gear will always come down automatically during Land mode or RTL."

The crash was very strange, I noticed the GPS was not good and was all over the place so I switched to Land mode to get it down from 30 meters. As it started to decent it went crazy and dropped rapidly about 5-10 meters. then it caught itself, then it tipped and dropped again, but this time I switched to stabilize and gave it throttle. It caught itself for a second about 5 meters off the ground then tipped and crashed. It was very strange as in land mode I believe the GPS should have no effect and in stabilize mode thre should be no effect at all. This vehicle has a LIDAR Lite V2 as well hooked up through the PWM Ports as described in the Wiki which the readings look all over the place during the time of decent so maybe that was at play? Still trying to figure it out though, very strange as even in stabilize mode it crashed after catching itself."
468,Pixhawk loiter mode drift position after FF,0,"Hi guys, hope someone can point me about that. Hovering in calm day it does fine but If I pust FF or any direction and want just to stop centering the stick only it stabilizes but drifts 15-20 meters before stopping the copter. It doesnt brake at the point I centered the stick like i.e. DJI WKM or A2 (they required a couple of meter at max to stop the copter).  I´m using the latest arducopter firm and remember on my first trial on a 3.1 firm I saw the copter pushing braks for a very short time and stabilizing just after that, may be not enough brake as the copter drifted too may be 10 meters due to the inertia but better tan right now.   Have completely no idea about which parameter/s takes care of this behavior and should be tweaked to increase the automatic response to hold the position after the fast speed flight. PD: NEO8 GPS with 10 sat and 0.8 to 1 HDOP. All vibrations below recomended values, compass calibration both normal and with THR passed, no trim needed, autotune done.  Tested platform is a simple F450 3S with original DJI engines and ESCs. 10x5 airscrews and no payload so it is a low mass unit currently with the last arducopter firm. Tried today to play with few values to see what happens. WPNAV LOIT MINA   it is supposed to be the one that takes care alone or whit the WPNAV LOIT MAXA of this behaviour but beyond that LOITMINA one shows a faster reaction in ALTHOLD mode so long as the value increases (Tested from 25 to 40) but can´t feel any apreciable change in LOITER.  LOIT MAXA slows the general stick reaction as the value increases (tested up to 2000).  As this value is related to the WPNAV LOIT SPEED setled at 1/2 of the speed it should work also over this 1/2 trying to increase the brake efect when the sitcks are centered after a FF flight ( in this case the centered stick work like a woypont it has arrived to). Tested WPNAW LOIT JERK up to its max of 2000 but cant feel any difference from 1000 value it comes with as starting point. It is possible this is the way the pixhawk is supposed to work and I´m looking for an impossible thing but if no one tells me opposite I will follow with my tests. In any way if someone can point me to a certain parameter that must be tweaked wll be glad to Heard about it. Thanks in advance and have a nice day",

472,Compass Auto Detection,0,"So I understand that Pixhawk will auto detect when a 3DR GPS/Compass (and compatible devices) are connected. In the Compass Calibration in MP, Pixhawk is selected, and no Manual Orientation settings are entered. I do believe that the compass is located underneath the printed circuit board of the 3DR, in other words “upside down”. In a non-Pixhawk application (such as APM) that does not auto detect, one could assume that the 180 degree roll orientation would need to be set to 1. My question is: I connect the compass to Pixhawk, and perform the calibration. When I look at the Full Parameter list, I see the fields for COMPASS_EXTERNAL and COMPASS_ORIENT remain at 0. Should these values not change to 1 if the Pixhawk auto detected the compass? Or does Pixhawk detect it, but the values are not necessarily updated in Arducopter? Thnx, 34S.",
473,3.3.1 OSD and telemetry conflict,1,"Hi There I just upgraded the firmware to 3.3.1 and beside all the new tones I noticed that when the OSD and telemetry are connected (mission planner, tower or droidplanner) there are some funny behavours.

If both the telemetry and the OSD are connected, no matter if I change the mode form the remote or the GS, the mode on the OSD screen blink between STAB and the new selected mode. I am now concerned to go and test it on the field as I am not sure in which mode the copter is. Attached is a link to a small video and the issue replicate itself every time. With the previous firmware 3.2 everything was working smoothly. Has anyone experienced this or is someone able to explain what’s happening? Thanks for the help F * *","Weird… Could you give more information about your setup ? Is it minimosd? which FW verison? I have minimosd ( HK , mine from 3dr is fried ) with 3dr telemetry radio and everything is running fine. How do you connect the minimosd to pixhawk? Only with rx connected? How  your serial parameters (sr0*) are setup? Regarding the current mode your copter is , the only trustworthy  method would be to arm the copter without the propellers on , change the modes and then, after, analyse the log. My two cent is that the modes should be OK."

It really must be a problem with the motors order, the spin direction or the propeller mounting.  * Also make sure your vehicle is a “+” or “x”.  The config shows FRAME = 1 which is correct for an “x” frame.  I think an s1000 is an “x” but maybe when you were doing the motor order you were looking at the “+” setup?  I’m not sure of course, I’m sure you’re being careful but it’s just got to be the motor order, the motor spin direction or the prop mounting that’s the problem."

Going down the list goes around the frame in a counter-clockwise direction. I’m confident that the motor directions and propeller rotations are correct. The problem must lie in the torque of the motor fighting the horizontal component of thrust from the motor tilt. I have un-reversed all the motors, swapped propellers, and swapped motor arms around to correct the counteracting torque/thrust issue. I also noticed there is a new firmware update, so after I update the firmware (if the weather ever clears up) I will give it another test flight."

If you’re using SBUS to communicate to FC, no matter what setting you make on your receiver, Ardupilot will “hold” all channels and do what’s set up on the  FS_THR_ENABLE option. If you set it to disabled, you’re going to have a flyaway, as the FC will hold last commands until your battery drains"

482,PPM Systems & FS_THR_VALUE woes,0,Greetings! I just upgraded to 3.3.1 and was having some issues with FS_THR_VALUE using a * which cannot have it’s MIN Throttle Value trimmed below 988 using PPM ( didn’t try PWM so it might work there ) - Luckily the Crossfire offers the choice to use Failsafe CUT instead of Failsafe Stick Position which still required some trial and error to get it working while I was still running 3.2.1 by setting FS PWM to 0 which autocorrected to 800. Enter the 3.3.1 - What basically happened here was the following: [ol] [li]Upgrade to 3.3.1[/li] [li]FS_THR_VALUE Error appeared - Copter wouldn’t arm.[/li] [li]Performed RC Calibration.[/li] [li]FS_THR_VALUE Error still in effect.[/li] [li]Increased FS PWM to 950 - I was reading that the FS PWM Value had to be 910 or more.[/li] [li]FS_THR_VALUE Error disappeared - Even in flight the motors would shut down when the Throttle Stick was put at lowest position and immediately start up again when moved slightly up.[/li][/ol] Not very comfortable with this I decided to *: [ol][li]Performed ESC Calibration.[/li] [li]FS_THR_VALUE Error still gone - Motors would now keep spinning when Throttle Stick was put at lowest position even when on the ground. Until the 5sec Disarm kicks in.[/li][/ol] Can anyone explain this or maybe confirm this being the proper way of solving it and not just a fluke? I mean I was kinda lucky with the ESC Calibration and it solving it for now but I’d still like to understand what has happened =),
483,Reference level for Sonar or LIDAR vs. barometric altitude,1,"I’m unclear on how sonar and LIDAR are used for reference altitude readings as opposed to barometer-based altitude readings. I assume that sonar or LIDAR (when available) are used for altitude references below a certain altitude as determined from the barometer referenced from the ground at arming time (e.g. below 20 feet? Can this value be changed?) But what happens when sonar or LIDAR are in use in a situation with an intermediate obstacle? For example, assume you start at point A, rise to 15 feet altitude (with sonar or LIDAR enabled), and then head toward point B, also at 15 feet altitude referenced from the ground at arming time at point A. However, between A and B is a structure 10 feet tall. When the quad reaches the structure (again, still assuming sonar or LIDAR in use), will it rise up 15 feet above the structure, with the top of the structure being the new “ground” reference point, or will the quad fly level at 15 feet as referenced from the ground (so, 5 feet above the structure)? If the former behavior is the default, can the latter behavior be specified? Thanks!","I’m a bit curious about this as well, and need to do more testing and dive into the code now that I have a Lidar Lite. I have a project where I’d like to launch a drone from a rooftop. If I rise to an altitude of 20ft off the rooftop, then fly over the edge , where I’m now 50ft above ground, will my drone decrease 30ft of altitude? Ideally, I’d like to reference altitude based off the initial home position (rooftop), but I suspect that without also integrating data from the baro/gps, there’s no way to know true altitude from Lidar - just the height above whatever’s below it."

Thanks!","* * It may be that we’re actually defining a new flight mode here, a precision low-level flying mode that indeed uses both the baro and lidar (gps could also be used as a secondary check). I haven’t looked at the relevant section of code in detail yet, but what’s needed is to establish a desired “baseline” altitude and use that for reference in this mode (which itself could be used in another mode such as Auto, which apparently does not currently support sonar or lidar – I’m looking into enabling that also). To use your type of example, we start on a rooftop. Use lidar to rise to a precision 10 feet (referenced from the roof). We save that value as our precision altitude baseline. We fly beyond the edge of the roof, which we’ll say is 15 feet high. Lidar now reads 25 feet since it can now see the ground. How do we know from the lidar if we came to the edge of the roof and are now looking down 15 feet further at the ground, or if the copter just get blown upward 15 feet? That’s where the baro (and maybe the gps) come into play. For example, if the lidar suddenly shows that 15 foot change, but the baro has been relatively stable, we might assume that the lidar is registering a drop-off (e.g., from that roof) rather than a height change in the flyer itself (especially since a stable baro reading seems more reasonable to accept as valid than a suddenly changing one). Lots of details but this seems like a practical route worth thinking about."

They’re not used in Guided, Auto, RTL. In the former modes (AltHold, etc) the vehicle maintains a desired-rangefinder-alt as long as the ground (or something) is sensed below.  During this time, that desired-rangefinder-alt and the actual range from the sensor are used to adjust the barometer+accel based altitude estimate.  So in the example where the vehicle is flying 15m above the ground and then flies over a 10m object it will climb until it’s 15m above the object (i.e. 25m above the ground). If the sensor ever loses contact with the ground for more than about 1 second it the desired-rangefinder-alt and actual sensor are not used.  So in a different example, if the vehicle has a rangefinder with a range of 20m and the vehicle is flying 10m off the ground but then the vehicle flies off the edge of a cliff (which, for example, has say 100m dropoff) the vehicle will not descend.  Instead it will keep flying at it’s current baro based altitude. If the sensor regains contact with the ground (indicated by about 1 second of good sensor readings) it resets the desired-rangefinder-alt to the new sensor reading.  So for example, if the vehicle has a range finder with a 20m range and we begin the example with the vehicle flying about 50m above the ground then the range finder is not used.  If the ground is sloping upwards though in the direction the vehicle is flying, then when the ground reaches about 20m below the vehicle, the vehicle will suddenly see the ground and it will reset the desired-rangefinder-alt to 20m.  It will then maintain that 20m altitude above the ground.  I.e. if the ground continues to slope upwards the vehicle will maintain an alt of 20m above the ground."

Those python scripts send position and velocity requests to Copter (aka APM:Copter, ArduCopter) using MAVLink.  There’s no reason why a Pixhawk1 (or any of the clone boards) couldn’t fill the same role as the Pixhawk2 but it’s the python scripts and that companion computer that most people don’t have on their vehicles.

489,Compass Calibration Issues,7,"I have a Pixhawk purchased from a diydrones member on a 3DR 2014 Quad frame. So far I have not been able to get rid of the prearm compass checks.

I get numbers like that when the internal mag is mounted about 1cm from a large Helicopter motor, as often happens on helicopters.

But maybe later it would be interesting to combine engine tork and swashplate differential. I will try that later. To give you an idea, I was using this table with different values: * Do you think it is difficult to edit the code source to change the “weight” of each input/output? Do you know in which file should I look for that? I have a developper friend who can help me editing the code and building from sources."

500,Unable to update / change SR0 settings in Full Params AGAIN!,1,The problem came back… after a reboot or two some of the SR settings in the params went back to the incorrect settings… grrrrrrr!!! So it’s NOT APM P2??? Sorry Bill… Could somebody change their SR1 Extra 1 and 2 to the setting of 6 and the SR1 Extra 3 to 1. Then see if after a couple pix reboots it stays?? It keeps going back to the old settings which at the moment I forget what they are… there are a couple more that wont stick as well. I thought it was my GC app APM P2 but no… so maybe it is an issue with 3.3???,It’s very unlikely that it’s the Copter firmware that is doing this.  It’s the ground stations that set these parameters.

My setup is composed of: Pixhawk, Arducopter Minimosd ( 2.2 extra ) ) Frsky d8r-II plus ( with D8r-XP fw ) For frsky rx to work you need a special cable connected to port 2 on rx to Pixhawk sbus On ardupilot, make sure those parameters are set accordingly: RSSI_Pin = 103 RSSI_range = 3,3 ( or 5v depending on RX ) You should also  be able to watch your RSSI shown up in mission planner, by right-clicking on hud -> user items -> RXRSSI checkbox If the value is displayed inside mission planner, it is definitely a minimosd issue.

Your second and third logs both look like they were reasonably solid autotunes. However, I do see a little kink in the rate step response that may be caused by your batteries moving. This also appears to be likely based on your photos of your quad. We also see this when gimbals are in place but your gimbal is pretty light compared to the rest of the frame so I think the batteries are the likely culprit. So can you move the batteries at all under the frame?"

I got those values by reading the mission planner parameters after the autonune , on next flight. I could have mess up with them when transcribing my notes or it could have been something else. I’ll pay more attention to that to figure it out… The batteries are pretty tight but they do have some play. The battery holder arms and the whole system deforms a little bit if I push them, but I need to apply some force for that. If I hold the frame and simulate the movements i cannot see any play. But , for sure, it could be the reason for the difference between AT runs among roll. Could you point me how to read the AT values from the logs? I have tried to learn it but couldn’t find. I’ll post below my latest autotune log and my current PID settings. What I have made was to decrease ( and round ) the values by same factor until I got rid of the bouncing. I can move the batteries. Like they are now, the frame is well balanced on both axis. If i move them under the frame it will be a little unbalanced because of the gimbal. Should I try autotune again like that (little unbalanced ) or should I get rid of the gimbal and put batteries straight above, well centered? Thanks!"

I don’t think those roll vibrations are coming from the copter, I think that is the wind hitting your gimbal. I say this because I was watching your motors or landing gear when they happened and I couldn’t see the frame moving in a way that would cause those shakes. I also can see the gimbal does take out the fast movement of the frame when I see the frame moving. It doesn’t take much flex to cause issues like this, but it may also simply be because you are tuning with a high value of Autotune_AGGR. I would suggest that you save these PID settings and enjoy the copter. Then if you feel like it I would do another autotune with AUTOTUNE_AGGR set to 0.05 in perfect conditions. And see if that gives you nicer values right out of the gate. To me things really look good so I would just enjoy it mate!! There are two things about this that really put a smile on my face. First your yaw response is really crisp and assertive. (If you want to make it a little more gentle drop your ACCEL_YAW_MAX a little). The second thing is I love the fact you felt comfortable enough to go flying in 40km/h gusts and then get the quality of video you got there. I know that many people wouldn’t even consider flying in those conditions, especially using other systems. I know Arducopter will handle this because part of my control loop testing is in the worst conditions I can find but many people haven’t realised how well these machines can handle rough weather."

I feel very very confident to fly with Ardupilot, because the quality of the code ( I’m studying it a lot), and 3dr pixhawk and GPS. You guys are great! I have mainly changed the frame from quad to hex in order to be more confident regarding hardware failures, specially with the motors. But, as a side effect I’ve find out that the bird is way more stable than the quad in chaotic wind conditions; I mean chaotic because that day there were a cold front approaching. It is important to note that I have never heard anyone highlighting this characteristic. Regarding the gimbal, I’ll try to raise their PIDs or motor power , hoping that it would be more resistant to the wind. I’ll watch carefully the weather conditions to find another day like that ( last autotune)  to test it with d 0.05. They are rare… Since here where I live I have plenty of open space with rough weather, whenever you need me to test anything, I’d be very glad to help. Cheers,"

Until that’s done, you could manually set the MNT_RC_IN_ROLL, MNT_RC_IN_PITCH values to higher numbers than “8”. The lost copter alarm can be triggered by holding both sticks on the transmitter down and right.  Sorry, this isn’t documented anywhere so we will have to add that."

506,Looking for your help on the APM flight control algorithm,1,"Recently I’m learning about the APM flight control algorithm, and I have a question about the pos_to_rate_z function. Here is it: void AC_PosControl::pos_to_rate_z() { 。。。。。。 * 。。。。。。 } I have no ieda about the  linear_distance variable, why should we need it? Or How it works?","Shark, This is more of a development question so feel free to email *. Leonard Hall is the designer of the position controller so he knows better but my understanding is that this “linear_distance” is the distance (in cm) from the target location when the position controller’s switches from using a linear to a square-root response.  So taking a step back, this part of the code is responsible for converting a position error into a desired velocity.  So when the vehicle is very close to the target position, the response will be linear.  For example, a 1m position error would lead to a 1m/s desired velocity response.  When the vehicle is much further from the target position the response is non-linear.  So for example if the vehicle is 40m from the target the desired velocity might be 6.3m/s (sqrt of 40).  At 50m from the target it might be 7m/s."

The issue has to do with the yaw to throttle mixing that is present in the code. If you craft is underweight try adding more weight and re-running auto tune.

508,Multiple battery monitoring combine amperages?,1,"Have seen BATT2 emerging in APM 3.3 - which is very welcome, but everything I have spotted so far points to two completely independent monitors. Two independent voltage monitors is fine for me, one to monitor the flight power source and one to monitor the avionics battery. I’m not really worried about monitoring the avionics current, but I would like to combine the BATT and BATT2 amperage to help monitor the flight power. My flight power is two 6S packs, each (for resilience) wired to the power distribution board. I appreciate if I used a ‘Y’ lead I could use one ATTOpilot sensor; but I have two separate leads, each with their own in-line sensor, soldered to the power board, one per pack. As the packs as paralleled up, the voltage will be common. The separate currents, if logged/monitored, may give an extra indication if one battery is mismatched or running down faster than the other, so two independent mAH figures are useful. The reason for the question is my concern is that, for those who run parallel batteries in maximum resilience configuration, unless the two amperages can be summed in real time, COMPASS_MOT cannot be used. Are there any plans to add any summing capability? Dave Martin","Dave, As you say, the two monitors are very different and only one of them is used for failsafes, compass-mot, and battery voltage compensation. I’m afraid we won’t be able to make this enhancement in Copter-3.3.  If you could raise an issue in the issues list then that would probably be best. *"

514,Crash : autotune gives very low P-gain on roll axis,0,"Hi, first of all my config :  3DR Pixhawk mounted with foams Quadcopter S500 frame (equivalent of F450 but stiffer arms) T-Motor MS2216-9 and Graupner E-Prop 9-5"" 400g 4S 3700 LiPo under the frame, aligned with the forward axis HK F-30A ESC flashed SimonK  I fly with this configuration since a couple of months now and I made the PID tuning manually, which gives good results. I had to lower the default roll and pitch P-gains as my copter is slightly overpowered. After that, I updated to 3.3rc10 and tried autotune functionality, with no wind. It seemed to be a success as all axis were twitching. I saved the new PIDs into the EEProm according to the online doc. Then I tried to take-off again but it rolled slowly while taking-off until a soft upside-down crash. I tried a second time with the same result. Going back home, I looked at the log. I saw that all the Pitch values (P, D, ATC_accel) were almost good and close to the ones I found manually, but all the Roll values (P, (D), ATC_accel) where way to low to allow the copter to fly (rate_rll_P~0.02, rate_rll_D=0.004 the minimum allowed value, ATC_accel_R~36000).

516,Copter 3.3r8 Wandering Yaw Tricopter,1,"Hi all, I have an interesting situation with a tricopter that had otherwise been flying perfectly well in Stabilize, Loiter, Drift, etc. with 3.2.1. Since updating to 3.3, I had attempted an autotune that I think didn’t work well due to wind and my fairly constantly having to roll/pitch to keep it from getting too close to obstacles. Now, with 3.3r8 I was unable to fly in stabilize and it was awfully twitchy. Yaw was wandering, and not consistently. So I reset everything to defaults, redid ESC, RC, Accel, and Compass calibration to try the new autotune in 3.3. The wandering yaw persists. In this test flight, I just took off in the back yard and attempted to keep it at a steady hover. Right away yaw was wandering as if the compass was creeping one way, then I would adjust and get it nose out, then it would wander again one way or another. So even in Stabilize, I couldn’t keep it steadily nose out. Does this Yaw/DesYaw show anything of interest? You can see it spinning, and this is me just trying to keep it straight. [attachment=0]Screen Shot 2015-07-28 at 7.56.24 PM.png[/attachment] It seemed an awful lot like the compass just being way off, but this exact craft was just flying perfectly and compass calibration has always gone just fine. Interestingly, just going between Flight Data and re-doing Accel calibration, there are a few times I would go into Flight Data and see the horizon as if the tricopter was completely upside down. I saw the “Compass Variation” error a few times, and one time a power cycle on the Pixhawk ‘resolved’ it, which seemed strange to me. I am hoping this jumps out at someone and you can educate me on what it up, thanks!","here is the tlog as well in case it is helpful. In the beginning you can see me fiddling with repeating accel (and maybe mag) calibration, followed by crazy “Bad AHRS” and the HUD horizon flipping. Toward the end is the flight, and it appears to faithfully show what I experienced. What it felt like in flight both in Stabilize and Loiter was that it lost its reference point for yaw rotation so I had to constantly adjust the yaw stick to keep it straight vs. where it wanted to go at the time."

Noise in the servo signal? Why all of a sudden on a craft that had been flying fine for weeks? Just in case it is meaningful, one change I made was moving the power module to the inside of the frame instead of hanging off the back, and mounted the FrSky voltage sensor to the underside.

No more wandering yaw in stabilize, and solid Loiter even in today’s wind. Can someone shed some light on the differences in Stabilize for 3.3 that could cause this? It truly felt like it was driving the servo randomly. Is the servo no longer on Channel 7 for the 3.3 version? It did “sort of” work. I thought it would be interesting to look at RC_IN channel 4 (rudder) and RC_OUT channel 7 (yaw servo). It seems strange to me as it doesn’t directly track the stick input like other logs I’ve seen.

I am guessing that this is not firmware but I am not sure.","Just an update, still not solution though.  I am posting this in the hope that it helps the Developers identify any issues with the 3.3 code that may be causing this.  I am flying fine with 3.2.1 and will continue to do so, I just thought that the Dev community would like to know if there are still issues running 3.3 on various boards. I have done 1: complete recalibrations, 2: Disassembled my machines and tried running them with minimal electronics running, 3: loaded custom code to test while connected to USB (So no RF  transmitter/receiver interference would be encountered) 4: Swapped out all GPS/Compass cabling 5: Changed GPS modules (although they are all the same 3DR model) 6: Reloaded GPS config from GITHUB 3DR GPS config file in the libraries folders I have been hacking my way through the code and can narrow down the issue to the position estimates but I am not sure what is failing. I notice that all of my logs show a flat line for EKF2>Ratio and the horizontal position estimates and readings also show flat lined values. I had 3DR support look at my 3.2.1 logs and as far as they can see there is no hardware error.  So that’s good! I still get the EKF Variance (EKF_CHECK-2) on all of the following machines: 3DR Y6B running Pixhawk-v2, 3DR ESC & Motors, 3DR uBlox-6 series GPS/Compass. Cinetank Mk-2 with Pixhawk-v2, T-Motor ESC’s and motors, 3DR GPS/Compass FPV250, with Pixhawk-v2, Afro ESC’s, Multistar motors. All of them do exactly the same thing which is to immediately switch into EKF Failsafe as soon as I arm. (With or without GPS lock). Something has been bothering me though, with no lock my GPS will report it’s position as the last place it had a 3D Fix.  Is that normal and will the non moving, fixed GPS position fight against the EKF even though it does not have a 3D fix? Thanks and I know that this will be low on the priority list but I hope it helps.  I can see that the work on 3.3 has some great stuff and I can’t wait to try the release version (as long as I can get it to work on my machines). Here is a log from a short 3.3-rc7 hover flight.  All flight control parameters are at default. *"

I think it was due to the new code requireing a better GPS lock than previous versions.  Initally 3.3 would give me an EKF failsafe  and not allow me to arm in any mode but now it is working. I have been enabling the fence to make sure that the EKF is happy with GPS lock as MP will report a 3D fix before the EKF is trully happy.  Still a few issues with getting POSHOLD to lock properly but it seems to be working. I also tried M8N and LEA-6 GPS modules and I have found it very hard to get the LEA=6 to get a good enough lock for 3.3 to work properly. Thanks for the help.
522,Tarot TL65B44 small electric retractable landing gear,1,"Hello, I want to know how can I control the servos. I will place a link with the product: * Can someone help me with a datasheet? Best regards, Vlad","Those retracts don’t require a separate controller. They operate from a standard servo control signal, when the signal is above threshold (probably 50%) they move one way, and when below they move the other way; there is no way to drive them to an intermediate position. Note you should supply power to these separately from your flight controller, and NOT directly from your receiver given the potential for high stall currents. Typically a spare BEC from one of your ESCs can be used to directly power them. In my case, I have the control signal connected directly to the receiver, and I use a spare channel on my radio to manually control them. Recent versions of ArduCopter include some facility to automatically lower (but not raise) the gear using an AUX channel, but I haven’t set that up yet. Also, given you have 2 of these, you probably need to use a ‘Y’ harness to connect them in parallel so that they will operate together. Here are mine in action, *"

Upon landing the helicopter something went really wrong, it cut out connection to RC, and continued to output a PWM to the motor from Channel 8, so essentially I couldn’t stop the helicopter’s motor from running, and I was forced to sit and watch the helicopter run until the batteries died.  We tried disarming the pixhawk via mission planner but it didn’t fix the problem, and just served to end our data logging.  Basically my question is thus: is it possible for the pixhawk to overheat, and just maintain a latest pwm output to the motor channel, and cut out connection with the RC? Is this a deeper problem with my particular pixhawk and would it need to be replaced? Or should I be looking at potential ESC problems?

Then if it is a high value I would look into the flight mode and condition. If this is a bug in the software it sounds like it could be very dangerous.

I’ve personally had a brand new pixhawk with faulty MIC5332 and it does seem to actually be quite common thing for this chip to go wrong. This chip has internal current limiting and also over temperature shutdown - so if it was a fully working chip it wouldn’t be able to provide more than ~500mA at 3.3V, so around 1.5W, this kind of power would not be able to cause a damage you are showing there. On top of the current limiting there is a thermal shutdown - once things get too hot, the chip will just shut down and not provide any power - this is again before any kind of damage occurs. I think you got your cause and effect wrong - it was the faulty MIC5332 that damaged the SD card, not the other way."

530,Pulsedlight on pixhawk 3.3rc5,1,"Hello all. Just received my pulsedlight mini yesterday, got it installed on my Pixhawk controlled 680pro last night. Followed the wiki, used the PWM, not the I2C, but I noticed there’s a descripency with the instructions. It first says use range finder type ‘5’, than later it says to use type ‘4’. Using type 5 works as in I can see information being populated and updated in sonarrange and sonarvoltage, so apparently is working and fairly accurate,  but I get a prearm warning, “check rangefinder”, and pixhawk fails the prearm test and will not arm with safety switch. Wiki states I can turn off prearm test “parameters/sonar”. I cannot locate the parameters/sonar, I have just “parameters”, and when I turn off prearm test “check parameters”, pixhawk passes the prearm tests, and can then arm via safety switch. I have a rack that the lidar ‘sees’ through, so while sitting on my workbench, lidar is showing 0.54 in sonarrange, so it passes the distance requirements it seems. If I use type 4, pixhawk passes prearm tests no problem, but no information in sonarrange nor sonarvoltage, so it seems pixhawk is not accepting the information from lidar. If I have to disable the prearm test, I’d like to be specific, as in parameters/sonar, not just parameters. Other than that, seems to work. Also, I used a 500 ohm resistor, and using beta version of mission planner, 1.3.28.3 build 1.1.5632.31781. Going to conduct some test flights today after work. Wish me luck…","Update on today’s test flight in one word: Awesome… TARA (680pro hex, my young girls always name my RC stuff girls names, lol.) Armed up right away, took her  to about 12 feet, hit althold and let wind drift her over my van( I live in central Florida, so not many elevation changes here), she got over van and went up right away, then upon clearing the van, dropped back to same height. Then set to loiter, flew over some buildings, but at 90’, same result, worked great. Best thing though, I set her at about 3 feet agl,  and flew around various patterns, it was like she was on a stand hovering around, no variations.

I checked the log and during RTL, the climb rate (CTUN.Crt) was -200. CTUN.DCrt was also -200. However, my WPNAV_SPEED_DN is set to 300  What may limit the descent to 2 m/s? The way up happened with 500 cm/s as specified by my WPNAV_SPEED_UP parameter so I don’t really understand why the copter is not trying to reach a climb rate of -3 m/s during RTL. Thank you.

I can shoot stills comfortably at 1/125th and above.  However, video is unusable at this point… Having read many many discussions and how-to’s on tuning I am still struggling getting it smoothed out… Camera is attached to DYS 2-axis gimbal…  I suppose it’s tuning and dampening could be part of the problem as well but logic tells me I have to get the copter as smooth as it can be first… Yes, I have balanced the motors and props… The question,  What is the Autotune program’s goal?  Asked another way, Is Autotune trying to get PID’s as high as possible without oscillation? After an Autotune, what approach should an AP fly take to smooth it out for best video… My approach has been to back off P and I and raise D…  I have found I have D at .020 wich appears to be max  MP will not let me tune it higher… So, my next approach was/is going to be to turn D down to 0 or near 0 and increment it up with P and I and the Autotune results… To add to the difficulty, The rig is too big to tune while holding,  I have no Jig to tie it to.  So, I have to tune in the air…  I can’t really use my FPV feed for fine adjustments so,  I make a PID adjustment, fly and record for 2 minutes, land, make and adjustment and repeat… I have only one battery so, I can do this 5 or 6 times… before leaving the field and get to home base and review my videos… My recent test…  * Thanks!","i think your problem is just vibration. autotune tunes PID settings by itself and takes approximately 7 minutes.  the pid settings is can be different depending your copter’ weight,  motors, and props.

Conclusion  - put the gps connector where it always has been connected in older versions , but put the compass in the socket underneath the GPS  called “ OLD STYLE GPS “ . I still wish this sort if information was better documented and silk screened  properly.- Also to make the external GPS-COMPASS work properly do NOT have any jumpers put on in the GPS side of the board.- NOTE.- Unbelievable by doing all this test and trials I still did not blow anything on the board…!!! thanks God for that…!!! I hope this information saves to somebody a lot of time , effort and money .!!! Kind regards to all. PS…Peeewhhh…that was a close one to blow the board…!!!"
537,Preferred way to control APM2.6 output in mission/manually,0,"Hi, I’ve been reading and trying a lot these weeks, but it seems all the features and workarounds that are supposed to do this are broken or disabled in current firmware. So I hope someone can help the other way around: How can I switch an output of the APM-2.6 in two states, 0V/5V, by mission commands and/or by radio? Purpose is to have a relay switch connected, which I can’t get to work on the documented A9 pin. Thanks",
538,Rangefinder on different flight modes?,0,"Hi all, Can I change the parameters in 3.3rc5 so that drift mode uses the rangefinder [sonar_range] to maintain altitude, or does new parameters need to be created, to be released in a later version? I read that APM Plane uses rangefinder in cruise mode, that’s kind of like drift mode.",
539,Problems with logs,1,"I have the latest version of Mission Planner 1.3.28 Flown with my octocopter 3.3 and today 3.4 dev For some time there are no readable logs when using USB connection and download with mavlink. The date of the files are correct, the times in the log are 2014-12-17 Removed the SDcard and put it in my computer When I open the latest log all time stamps are 0001-01-01 00:00:00.000 If I click the field it changes to 2014-12-08 13:40:46.711 The time is exactly the same from top to bottom but the log should be about 20 minutes Any idea what causes this? Thanks Anders",By unreadable I’m referring to the “Value Graph” in the Log browser.
540,Are the PID control loops the same in 3.2 & 3.3?,1,"Ok, two part question really, second depends on the first.   is 3.3 ready for me to test in a quad that I just tinker with?   If I run auto tune in 3.3, so I can get yaw tuning, can I copy those PIDs back to 3.2?   thanks  ","Dont see why not, run auto tune, save parameters, reflash firmware, set everything back up, then try and load the saved parameters. I noticed that 3.3 autotune made my 680pro really, really twitchy, and in althold/loiter was real unhappy.  Also auto tune took a long time, like 15 minutes, where as autotune on my quad w/APM2.6 (3.2.1), only takes 5 min or so. Although, hexacopter is kinda over powered, so that might be the reason. I reset to the default, and hexa flys superb, and in loiter, is rock solid."

A quick Yaw command, and it visually over shoots, and is also wobbly in windy conditions.The overshoot can be seen in the logs. When I autotuned this quad on 3.2 it got very twitchy in Loiter as well. I cut the Stabilize “P” in half for Pitch and Roll, and it is better. I left the Rate PIDs alone."
541,Landing gear not operating in Auto,1,I am running Mission Planner 1.3.28.4 build 1.1.5633.31488 and firmware 3.3-rc5.  I have made the following changes: 3way switch on taranis set to CH8 Retracts plugged into AUX1 Under Extended Tuning:  Set CH8 to Landing Gear In Full Parameter list RC9_Function is set to 29. In flight I can manual cycle the retracts but cannot get any sort or auto control. With switch in center I can arm and engage AUTO and the copter will auto takeoff and fly mission and RTH with nothing happening on the retracts.  If during the mission I manually switch the retracts up and then put the switch in the center the copter will try to land without cycling the retracts down.  Seems to be an inactive function.  I would appreciate any insight. I have also tried taking off in loiter mode and had no response from auto retracts.  Not sure if it was suppose to work in that mode as well.,"So landing gear works coming directly off of Pixhawk, cool. Didn’t work for me, but I was using older mission planer. Think ill try it, maybe, only have 1 3 way switch, and I’m using it to get 6 flights modes."
