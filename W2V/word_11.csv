Please use this only for things that are specific to the SkyViper.,"Hello Tridge, I just received the SkyViper in the mail today, I hate to say it, but it is unflyable? Even inside! with no mods firmware was loaded on initialization. Outside flight was uncontrollable with gps lock. Severe pitching. Inside flight start motors, would ramp up and continue to try to lift itself.Next, aplied full power on fresh battery no lift off. I have flown quads before and there is something wrong. In the app there was a recalibration notice which cameup, with no instruction on the how to?,I have seen the post from John on this. I believe the cause of this whole event( my theory) is the motor gear drive clearance.I have one motorgear that if you gently hold it can allow the prop drivegear to slip past the motorgear.<img src=""/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ec578f75c2023d0c70bbf77124fe9708ace400f3.jpg"" width=“375” height=""500strong text **NoMesh ** No Mesh Let me know what you think.Thanks"

I got the same low battery warning on the v2450HD (which is not Ardupilot).  It’s an app issue I think.  When the battery is truly critical the quad will switch to RTL (or land if Indoor) automatically.  I think it is settings issues or an app issue, since, like i said, I had the same issue with my v2450HD."

1,SkyViper discussion,27,This is a place to discuss the *.

1,SkyViper discussion,34,This is a place to discuss the *. Please use this only for things that are specific to the SkyViper.,"Safe, Tested Changes to Ardupilot for SV 2450GPS I’m a retired system programmer but a newbie to rc quads. Got a small SV quad for Christmas and I haven’t looked back. The 2450GPS is the third quad I’ve gotten and I love it. Been learning and flying the 2450 for only 4 months. The SV web server is so cool but way to easy to fu. I’ve learned a few dos and donts and wanted to pass it on to help newbies, especially kids and non-programmers. Under Actions on the SV web server, TMode_Action 1 thru 6 below are my personal favs but you can set them to whatever flight mode you want, except  TMODE_ACTION3. It defaults to disarm and I recommend leaving it as is, although you can set any transmitter button sequence to disarm. The power button is the easiest and most logical. Turning off the motors quickly when you crash is very important. As long as you leave it set to disarm, it will always work whether you’re flying or not. TMODE_MODE1 is the initial flight mode when you first takeoff. It defaults to Loiter, I just like PosHold better. Don’t change this to an expert mode like Acro or Sport. I recommend AltHold or PosHold. Don’t get confused about Indoor mode on the transmitter because indoor mode doesn’t really exist per se. Indoor is really Loiter without GPS. Under Tuning in the web server, PILOT_ACCEL_Z is the vertical speed. It defaults to 400 but I increased it to 500. This is your choice, just keep it reasonable, probably best to stay between 200 and 700. Haven’t yet found the actual rate in cm/sec. RC_FEEL_RP defaults to 50 but could be 1 - 100. The higher the value, the quicker the quad will respond, particularly roll and pitch. The lower the value the smoother the quad will respond. Under Radio in the web server, BRD_RADIO_TXMAX defaults to 4. The value can be 1 - 8. This is transmitter signal strength. I noticed when my quad was over 100 feet away, there was a half second delay when performing roll and pitch. Increasing it to 7 resolved this problem. See below: SKY VIPER WEB SERVER Flight Parameters Action Tuning Radio More parameters will be discussed in the days to come."
1,SkyViper discussion,35,This is a place to discuss the *. Please use this only for things that are specific to the SkyViper.,"Keep it up Michael. I love these. Honestly, I think the APWeb is one of the best features of the SV that * added. It makes it easy to “tinker” with it in real-time, rather than having to have a laptop with Mission Planner. I have played with a bunch of things but have shyed away from some of the tuning parameters, afraid to kill it  But I may play with those…and wondering if the BRD_RADIO_TXMAX somehow I accidently messed with that and it is the reason I am having so many issues with my radio dropping out. BTW, just for fun, my ACTION setup is  Mode+LeftTrigger = PosHold RightTrigger = Flip (which fails 90% of the time, need to see about making it flip MUCH faster) ACTION1=Loiter ACTION2=AltHold Mode+RightTrigger=Sport (this is the mode I’m in most the time) Mode+Power=ThrowMode  And I user Tower to play with Auto Missions (although sadly the video doesn’t work in Tower) Also, I’m running AC-3.6 ReleaseCandidate2 on my SV, so the Skyviper app doesn’t work anymore, but that’ ok, it barely worked when i used it."
1,SkyViper discussion,36,This is a place to discuss the *. Please use this only for things that are specific to the SkyViper.,"Hey lordneeko, glad you liked it. I hope it helps. Sport mode is my favorite too. But, when you say ‘radio drops out’, what do you mean exactly. The transmitter stops controlling the quad? Two things come to mind. Have you replaced the batteries and reloaded the the tx firmware. You mentioned that you use Tower. I use QGroundcontrol, which works pretty good. No video either. But when I re-calibrated my tx in QGC, the quad wouldn’t take off anymore. I had to reload the firmware and I did a factory reset. That fixed it but I was down for a week researching. Have you noticed any difference using AC-3.6 ReleaseCandidate2. I don’t want to lose the SV video app but would consider it if 3.6 is that much better. If I did, I might need a little help. I really like it that the SV app shows me exactly what flight mode I’m in."
1,SkyViper discussion,37,This is a place to discuss the *. Please use this only for things that are specific to the SkyViper.,"The only app which will show SV video (AFAIK) is Solex ($20! ouch!). But for “performance” Tower can’t be beat (IMO). I didn’t like the QGC interface, but probably because it was the second one i tried. My Tx drops out (especially) at certain angles, but I swear it used to be better. So that’s why i think it is setup. I even modded my antennas. Moved the quad’s antenna exterior (away from motors) and put a larger antenna on my Tx, and still have issues…but not AS bad.  I need to check the parameter though. You get the “newest” features when running master, but not everything is great. For example, some parameters and naming changed so the APWeb doesn’t line up with those new parameters. So you have to change them in Mission Planner instead (at least I did, when I did it in APWeb it didn’t stick).  There are new features like SmartRTL, which are neat, but I’ve yet to really dive into. Other than wanting to play with the “latest” there is no real good reason to update…IMO."

1,SkyViper discussion,46,This is a place to discuss the *. Please use this only for things that are specific to the SkyViper.,"It’ll work without a smart phone. The downside is it won’t download the latest firmware and GPS fix data. But it should work. Some tips:  You don’t have a GPS lock until the green light on the Transmitter stops flashing. If you take off while the GPS light is flashing (in GPS mode) it’ll take-off just fine, but it’ll actually only be in Altitude Hold mode. So you have to maintain position. If you get GPS lock after taking off, it’ll set the home position to whereever the drone is at, at that moment. So using RTL will cause it to fly where you don’t want it. Recommend flying it with AltHold first to get used to it, and ensure it is flying stable, before trying GPS mode. (I only recommend this because of not getting the latest firmware, which had a few fixes in it)  For the most part, everything should work great. Good job being an awesome grand parent. "

They’re support branch and order processing are unbelievablebly horrible. I don’t understand. It took 4 months for the parts store to get SV 2450 parts when they were still making the product. They had the parts for assembly. Why? And when they did get the parts, they only offer 2 modes of shipping, Standard Ups ground and Priority, which take at least 4 to 5 days for priority and God knows how long for standard with no tracking number at all. The orders cannot be tracked. But the order page says, don’t inquire about your order until after 2 weeks of waiting. Really? I am so disappointed in the company.

And, compounding the issue, their company takes almost the entire month of december off (the busiest time of year where people would be calling in for support) which really backs them up. Happened last year too.  They make killer products, and completely ruin everything with their support and parts NON availability. I will say though, that this product line (2018 versions) do have a little better parts supply than last year’s.  But, not for things you actualy want like gears, motors, and batteries.  But, if you want, you could buy all the internal for the 2700 for like $30 and build your own drone lol.

The targeted audience were always casual toy buyers who couldn’t care less about ArduPilot but surely a non-dismissable percentage of the 2500GPS and Journey sales were from tinkerers and hackers who want to play with the software, it’s sad that they don’t care about those customers."

It makes sense that the bean counters might question keeping a product that isn’t making money and the team may be forced to try and cut corners just to save the product line. Assuming SkyRocket pays at least something, somehow for ArduPilot, a few bucks difference per unit might matter. Nothing has changed on the status of delivery. Still saying ordered and delivery on Thursday, but not yet shipped. I’m very tempted to try the sdcard firmware upgrade but I’d rather wait to see if Amazon delivers an ArduPilot version.

The SE was produced in a different factory and required a different app to support it. The app is more straightforward than the previous version, focusing on essential features for flight.” When I replied back asking if the hardware supported Ardupilot and could use more complex software, I got a not so helpful answer again: “Our apps are the only options at the moment.

What might have changed, though, is the name of the firmware file that the current firmware looks for, if it even looks at all. I would think it hasn’t changed and that, for those that want to, I’m now thinking the SE would be indeed upgradeable. Maybe I’ll end up trying it on the new one I have. If it’s like some of the other toys I own, better two than just one, right? But good luck for me, this just showed up on Kijiji and it’s on its way!

Thanks in advance!","Amazon still hasn’t shipped a replacement. * But I’ve finally got my paws on an ArduCopter Journey and compared it to the SE I haven’t yet returned. * What I’ve learned:   The Journey SKYVIPER hotspot on the 2.4G band with the last 3 bytes of the MAC address portion of the ssid is displayed in hexadecimal vs the Journey SE which is on the 5.8G band and the mac address is displayed as decimal. This, I think, makes things easier for customer support. But, also, the switch to 5.8G may have solved some video performance issues?   SKYVIPER AP is at 192.168.99.1 on Journey and 192.168.80.1 on SE.   There is no website access on SE at 192.168.80.1 on port 80 or 8080   The open port scan on both units shows a very different profile   SkyViper SE (without ArduPilot) * * SkyViper Journey (with ArduPilot) * *   The Journey is able to get a GPS fix consistently and rapidly on the floor of my livingroom.  The SE was unable to lock GPS indoors no matter how long I waited. So I checked it outside and the SE was still unable to lock. Not sure why.   The Journey SE seems to be a US only product as I watched it move from Kent, WA to here in Canada, it has no mandatory French language on the packaging and the SE app retrieved by scanning the barcode says it is not available in my area. So not usable out of the box for me.   You can tell the Journey SE from the Journey by looking at the transmitter model number. I left the quad itself connected to the packaging so I couldn’t look underneath. Or take it apart. The FCC # is 24G on both so the telemetry is of course still 2.4G but the video/phone app hotspot is now 5.8G only, it seems. Nonetheless, the SE TX refuses to pair with the original Journey and vice-versa which would also be the case if both were the same model, so no new info there.   Journey SE * Journey * Some of the yellowing I mentioned above. Journey on top, SE underneath. * Anyway, the hardware is obviously different at least one way (video/app radio frequency band) so it is not so simple, although the SE platform may well deserve a port? What I would say is that the original unit is imo a great value and anything the community can do to stop them being land-filled one by one by the uninformed may be worthwhile."

It would be best if you could do a full port scan with nmap -O -sV to give some hints about which services are listening there and which OS. Maybe there’s still an ArduPilot there but the Sonix board was surely replaced based on your findings. You could try launching wireshark to sniff WiFi packets between the app and the SE.

And 554 is used for RTSP like the 2450GPS and Journey but the path might have changed. BTW you didn’t scan the full port range with that command, you’d have to add -p1-65535 to the parameters (it will take a while). Port 21 is open too. Have you tried with an FTP client? To sniff WiFi with wireshark/tcpdump you’d have to put the card on monitor mode, idk if the RPi supports that. Alternatively you can try setting up a fake AP for the app to connect to."

I’m guessing it’s probably some sort of proprietary command set wrapped in http, given the response that nmap produced contains a stock error message saying “Your  browser sent a bad request” although that may be what nmap does to try and determine OS. Maybe you know for sure what it’s doing? I’m a little to busy to dig it out. Sorry, I just entered the nmap command as you specified. I’ll rerun everything and try to connect to FTP 21 as well and see if I can get at an RTSP stream with VLC and the /media/stream2 url as well. Haha that was why I said I’d do the wiresharking another time as I’m aware that I’ll have some setup to tackle lol. Apparently prolific mode is available on wired ports but I’m not sure about wireless. I checked today and Amazon wants it postmarked by Feb 1 for return so I have some time. I also just scanned the Ardupilot developer page for the Sky Viper and see a technique for having the Sky Viper attach as a station to an AP by putting a text file on the sdcard with AP details. I may try doing that as well as it might be something the techs would want to be consistent across all firmware. I’ll try it on my Ardupilot journey too so that I know it works there. Nice to have both units at the same time. WHich reminds me I should do a full nmap scan on it too while I’m at it. Okay so if there’s anything else you can think of let me know. It will be few days before I get back to it. Cheers!"

This was when I wasn’t sure I’d ever get a non-SE unit. To me, the SE is looking like any other manufacturer’s drone now that I know it’s not so easy. As I mentioned above, I can’t even get the SE app you’re suggesting I use (without jumping through some hoops). I’m grateful that SkyRocket released the original ArduPilot products and I realise that the low end drone market is brutal (local hobby shop won’t carry ANY quads but DJI) so I respect their SkyRocket’s attempt to pivot.  And maybe what we’ve done here so far will help them because they won’t get unnecessary tech support calls from people who are confused, especially if a used unit they get/buy without packaging isn’t working as expected. I’m curious but definitely not enough to keep it and try porting to it. And, as new, it’s too expensive to keep for parts, but at least knowing what I’m looking at will help me if a used/broken one comes along for cheap. P.S. I’ve solved my 5.8G problem by ordering a $4 USB dual band WiFi dongle but who knows when that will show lol although I guess their’s no guarantee that it will do monitor/prolific mode. Although probably not necessary for this."

But you could raise the fake AP at 2.4GHz and the app probably won’t care if it’s not 5.8G and will try to connect, then listen for connection attempts. There’s a chance the thing can speak MAVlink, and we don’t know for sure if it’s running some version of ArduPilot on the FC. When you connect thru WiFi with the Journey you are not connecting to the FC but to the companion board. It may be that they couldn’t source anymore the Sonix board and had to replace it with something else, but the FC is maybe the same."

As it was I couldn’t even see it from my windows box but I’m assuming the cheapo dongle would have allowed a simple AP connection. I must say it annoyed me that I had to stop at that point so I’m glad I will have 5.8G capabilities for when this type of thing happens. I didn’t even have wireless turned on because this box is wired. Yes, the FC could well be ArduPilot but it could just as well be CleanFlight(ClearFlight?) as I think I’ve read elsewhere. It’s not hard to recompile existing code for different platforms especially if you already have a product line and expertise with a other FC software. Doing so means eventually not having to support multiple environments which can really simply (lower cost) tech support. Anyway I can’t even run the app or connect to it easily at the moment so I don’t think I’m the guy to take this one any further. The SE isn’t even supposed to be available in Canada; I got it by mistake. Eventually someone will have one they actually own to dig into because they can’t return it. I’ll just pick up a non-SE Journey used if I want another and spend time on the many other distractions of RC lol If things change I’ll post here"

Basically, the SkyViper team was let go after we launched Journey. I guess we did such a good job, they felt like we didn’t need to iterate further and they just planned for multiple years of churning out the same product over and over. From then on, it just becomes a game of “let China find a cheaper way to make it” and that tends to lead to cheaper parts that were promised to work ‘exactly like the original’ but as we all know… they do not. The v2450 GPS was still the one I’m most proud of. That had TaoGlass receivers, etc. The Journey performed well, but not AS good, due to the cheaper components. I have NO IDEA what’s inside an ‘SE’.

So it has gone back too and the refunds are done. Their ad still says Journey 1849 (the Ardupilot version) so, for those who want to order one, make sure that is what you get and not the SE. I was able to get 2 1849’s used (but like new units with good batteries) for not much more than a new one, so I’m set. Thanks for the help.

I haven’t abandoned the project but have purchased used ArduPilot Journeys. When I was testing out the SE, I had no trouble pairing the provided transmitter. I was under the impression that pairing for a package like this was already done or done automatically on power-up. So, just now, because I have two, I thought I would test that theory. My testing so far shows that the ArduPilot Journey drones and transmitters are not interchangeable out-of-the-box. Each drone connected quickly but only with the transmitter it was shipped with. Which implies there might be a pairing step that has been done already, either by the factory or by the previous owners of the two used units I now have. Maybe it’s in the instructions somewhere but I obviously haven’t needed it so I’m not sure. I’m going to have a look at the code for both the SkyViper and the transmitter to see what is going on. I’ll report what I find here but, of course, this will only apply for sure to the ArduPilot version. It may be the same/similar on the SE but who knows? But maybe the same procedure will work. This is why I held out for the ArduPilot version and open source products in general. Problems like yours can often be solved without even having to deal with customer service."

To get the transmitter to attempt to bind/pair, the left button (Launch/Land) should be held during power-on. Hard to say what protocol the SE is using but the left button is what is used to initiate DSM2 pairing on the ArduPilot Journey. You said you’ve tried that so it either it’s another procedure or your your unit(s) are faulty or maybe even mis-matched i.e. one is SE, the other is not. Make sure the FCC numbers on both the drone and the TX match. I put pictures of both on the other thread. Keep in mind also that the binding of the transmitter to the drone is not part of the video transmission (or the telemetry (GPS location etc.)?) which on the SE is done through regular 5.8G WiFi. Not sure what else to suggest. If you have any more questions, I’m just learning but maybe I can help. If you get it solved, please let us know! Here’s the code from the ArduPilot transmitter. Cypress is the name of the manufacturer of the DSM? chip/module: If no button is held, no pairing is initiated."

I originally developed support for the radio in the SkyViper using my taranis with an OrangeRX DSM2/DSMX JR module. I also tested it the other way, using a skyviper TX with a spektrum RX. Here are some tips that may help you get it working:  setup your TX to send just 7 channels setup your module to use DSM2 if you can. I have had it working with DSMX, but it is less tested on my orangerx module, I use the “single flash” mode for testing. That module actually supports 4 different protocols (no flash, single flash, 2 flash and 3 flash on LED). The single flash mode is one of the two DSM2 modes set BRD_RADIO_PROT to 1 for DSM2 protocol set BRD_RADIO_TELEM to 0 to disable the skyviper telemetry. The telemetry protocol is a custom one that is not understood by any other TX (source is available if you are curious how it works) when you start the bind in the web interface you will get an error if you are connected using another MAVLink TX. That error comes from it trying to also start bind on a serial connected radio (which you probably don’t have). Ignore the error. you may have to try to find several times, depending on your module. The orangerx only sends bind packets for a very short period of time, and the channel scanning for bind in the skyviper can miss them. Try multiple times. have a GCS like MissionPlanner or MAVProxy connected when you bind, watching the RC_CHANNELS MAVLink message, so you can see activity when you bind if you’re using a switch based TX (eg. taranis) then don’t try to get all the action buttons setup, instead set all of the TMODE_* actions and modes to disabled, and set FLTMODE_CH to your preferred flightmode channel then setup normal ArduPilot FLTMODE values as usual. Trying to emulate all the switches will just cause you to go crazy, as the UI is oriented towards pushbuttons, not switches. I’ve only tested this with two DSM2-compatible transmitters (the orangerx module and another low cost DSM2 compatible radio). It is likely that it won’t work wtih them all. The DSM2/DSMX protocol varies a lot between implementations. Basically this is not a real DSM2 implementation, I tried to make it DSM2 compatible as best I could, but no guarantees. Cheers, Tridge "

Anyway, to get this to work, I had to go through Tridge’s instructions. My module only puts out 6 channels to be aware of that if you’re using a hack kit. You’ll only get 7 or 8 if you use one from a DX7/8 or if you get the OrangeRx module from HK. I set my Taranis to run in DSM2 mode. Haven’t tried DSMX but you might see why. Set BRD_RADIO_PROT to 1 as indicated Set BRD_RADIO_TELEM to 0 Use the web interface and hit bind and right after, put the transmitter in bind mode. Repeat as many times as necessary until the green LEDs quit blinking on the SV. After you do it each time, give it 5-10 seconds to see if it bound. I found I tried too often and didn’t get it enough time. Be aware that I had to do it nearly 10 times to get it to stick. You may need to hit bind on the Taranis right after you click it in the web interface. Try some varied combinations but it will work. Once you do that, then do the rest of the stuff that’s in there. For a little clarification, I just changed TMODE_ENABLE, or whatever it’s called, to DISABLE (I think it’s 1?) and wrote to it. No need to blow out all the other TMODE_* parameters as once you disable it, the rest won’t show up in Mission Planner. As Tridge stated, make sure FLTMODE_CH is correct and then set all your flight modes like you usually would. I also turned off geofencing but might turn it back on again later. Be sure to run a transmitter calibration. Be sure to hold the bird down because I got the channels wrong somehow and also had everything backwards too at first but the rest is your typical setup and it should work just fine."

No problem binding, but I had to reconfigure some channels (compared to a typical ardupilot setup) on radio. Throttle and Elevator were swapped in my case. Some additional info, if this may help others. For stock Orange RX transmitter, *, setting it to DSM2, 2048/11ms (single flash) is pretty straightforward: Hit bind button 3 times quickly. It then cycles through 0,1,2 or three flashes. Keep doing it until you get one flash. Also remember that with a Taranis, you need to change model settings to enable  external RF (disable internal RF), and set PPM, also channel 1-7. As said above, using Mission Planner calibration page helps to see what’s going on, especially what each channels do."

I have torn down the drone since it only cost me $29.99 and I would love to be able to upload custom firmware for testing.

Thanks everyone, James","I’ve not done this, but if I needed to know, here is how I would go about determining the function of those pads:  Since the MCU package allows access to it’s pins, you should be able to lookup the pin assignments (either find the pins that can be assigned to USB in the data sheet, or the pins actually assigned by the ardupilot HAL layer code) and simply use a multi-meter to determine which pad is connected to which pin. I do think your guess of USB is a good one.  If you wanted to take a shortcut with some risk, you could even just check which pad is ground and guess the standard layout from there.  The people who lay out PCBs tend to be fairly rational   * or *, can you save James some trouble? Let us know what you learn!"

22,Connecting v2450gps to MAVproxy & Dronekit,1,"I previously posted a question about connecting to the Sky Viper using MAVproxy. I had done research and couldn’t find any instructions specific to it. After one day of trial and error, I finally figured it out and would like to share my findings in an accessible, easy to find format for anyone trying to get the most out of their Drone. It turns out my answer was in the very first page of the MAVproxy docs on Ardupilot *. There it says to use your local IP address, coming from a Web Development background, I assumed “local, 127.0.0.1 , of course” and the fact that you can connect to SITL using mavproxy.py --master=udp:127.0.0.1:14550 made me belive the same would work for connecting to the SV. Well, it does work, kinda. You will get the console, but the messages do not go through and neither will you be able to connect different GCS’ using the --out command. I also tried running ipconfig /all (I’m currently on Windows) and looking for every IPv4 on every network adapter, only to find the same result. After a lot of scratching my head I stumble upon an article for the Solo and noted that they used 0.0.0.0 as their connection IP address. That clicked to me that I had read that somewhere, a quick google search for 0.0.0.0 MAvproxy brought me right back to the docs (link above) where I read.  Alternatively the if the local IP address is not known, use 0.0.0.0 for MAVProxy find and use the local IP address.  That makes things easy, use 0.0.0.0 and you can not only connect on your Laptop, but you can deploy your code to a Pi, or any companion computer and use the same connection string (MAGIC!) In short, the command I ran successfully was:  mavproxy.py --master=udp:0.0.0.0:14550  I’d like to give you some advice also: If you’re indoors, trying to arm on guided mode is not going to work, because of the GPS checks made by Toy Mode (tmode parameter on web interface). Please, do not try to disable tmode to make this work, unless your code has been thoroughly tested or you know very well what you’re doing. Doing so, will make your remote unresponsive and not allow you to stop the engines, maybe causing some damage. Also, because of the lack of GPS connection indoor, your drone will fly crazy. If you’re trying to connect to more than one SV (swarm), change one of their output ports: * That is all for now, Cheers","Thank you! I have been trying to connect to a quad using an external ESP8266 like *. Like the Skyviper, these set up their own access point and you connect to it. I could connect fine to QGroundControl and Mission Planner but not on mavproxy and dronekit. I had tried 127.0.0.1 and the IP assigned to my laptop by the access point but no luck. After finding your post, I tried 0.0.0.0 and it worked perfectly. So, summary, 0.0.0.0:14550 will also work for connecting dronekit and mavproxy to the ESP8266."

I find I can select distance units by tapping “Feet” or “m” twice. But I cannot select the microSD card option - that button stays grayed out. After a few tests where I start video recording from the app, I see the videos are recorded on my phone but not on the card. I read the card on my linux machine and see a directory 6666-6331  on the card, but that directory is empty.

We’ve experienced the same issues some other people on here have reported, where the WIFI.txt doesn’t seem to work. After updating the firmware (to the most recent Dec 2017 version) I can replicate the issue where having a WIFI.txt on the card means it no longer creates its own access point (i.e. it seems to be attempting to connect to our network) but I can’t see any activity from anything else on the network using Wireshark. I’ve hardcoded the SSID and key into the Sonix firmware as suggested, but this doesn’t seem to have helped at all.

The trick to getting it attached to the TX2 was to ONLY permit WPA2 authentication. Incidentally, for something like swarming you will need to compile fresh Sonix code.

I’m totally new into this I manage to do a very little but now here is my big issue and concern… : I have a Sky Viper Journey and last time I tried to explore its capabilities and also trying to learn a little more about mission planner, I dont know what I could have done but what I know is after my drone battery went out of charge, I plugged it and a little later after that, when I tried to use my drone again… nothing… Tryed every single procedure  on sky viper support website i also did the factory reset, tryed to reboot the controller but the problem, is the drone doesnt give a damn about my transmitter… I can see that my transmitter is fine chanels seem to work like they were, my drone also works correctly motors can spin when i start the tests… but no answer to my transmitter, also tried the binding tricks… nothing changing mode 1 for mode … still nothing… what i find strange, is that since this issue, my transmitter is changing mode only when i press the Return Home button but not on the actual “mode” button… I also have no possibility to reconnect on the Sky Viper View 2.0 and yes, the drone is connected to the wi-fi … but now i just dont know what to do… is there anyway i could only just reset back my drone as like it was when i bought it? i dont care about restarting the configs over again, just want it to be able to turn on the transmitter, pushing on take off and see the propellers spin again… thank you in advance!!!        *",

37,Sky Viper Journey Pro Video GPS Drone V2700 -It's HERE!,20,Showing as in stock at Target!  *,"Aloha Matt, I bought the 2450gps and other than a few small issues, it flies. Occasionally triggers RTL at 50% batt. Occasionally behaves erratically on RTL cmd. That’s what happened to my first 2450. To replace it I ordered the 2700. Now I have major issues. First a firmware update is “available” but update appears unsucessful, app locks on blank background screen. In order to fly, update window must be ""skip""ped. The Launch function is erratic. Occasionally just lifts front end and skids out of control until crash or power button cycle. Once launched you must be ready  as it drifts erratically within a 10’ (approx.) area. You have to fly carefully as it will drift aimlessly and need to be corrected. It will continue in whatever direction you are flying until stopped with a control input. Throttle control is barely adequate, and unit often does not want to climb/decend. While flying, GPS Lock goes in and out, even tho GPS is in display and controller is in normal, 17-20 satellites showing. The worst part is that while flying the controller beeps* and unit stops flying. Beeps again, and props spin back up but drone drops without ability to control it, hits ground, and attempts to keep flying. “Landing” displayed and disappears without controller input. This looks like, but is not a battery issue. (Always begin flight fully charged, new batts in controller. This problem begins at first launh, either with button or stick. *Screen shows GPS lock on second beep but drone crashes at this point. Drone or controller switches modes briefly without button press. It sometimes displays mode changes that I have never seen. Ardupilot has not had any changes, yet shows change(s) being made (blue highlighted items) the one time I opened it. This drone is 50g heavier than the 2450 and appears to be unable to support it’s new weight. The problems I had with the 2450 were minor and at least it flew. This one DOES NOT! It crashes at least 5-6 times per charge and you cannot predict when problems are going to occur. Even in GPS mode I dare not fly it without at least 50’ square area, no wind, structures, people, etc. I have successfully calibrated the drone and problems persist. With this drone you must remain hypervigilant or risk crashing or worse. For some reason, the controller batteries die abnormally quickly. The 2450 was a (problematic) dream by comparison! Is this a recognized situation with fixes coming, or should I return the drone? Thanks, SE"
37,Sky Viper Journey Pro Video GPS Drone V2700 -It's HERE!,21,Showing as in stock at Target!  *,"For further consideration, the GPS Lock loss (and resulting altitude loss/crash) may have something to do with large or quick stick movements! I have to wonder if increasing the GPS unit scan rate would help? Most of the lock departures seem to come after some type of manuver is accomplished or during a descent. I also wonder about loss of voltage during manuver causing a disconnect of GPS function? I am hoping this model can be made to fly nearly as well as the 2450 even with the additional flying weight because of it’s cleaner build, nicer tx and more available features. Unfortunately, I need to make a decision within the next week about keeping this currently unpredictable drone, or go back to the comparitively crude 2450."

Since the flight boards don’t have current sensing on them, obstruction code was written into the firmware to try and ‘see’ when throttle command was given for X amount of time before it would initiate a motor kill to try and save the motors. We’ve seen what you described (inability to maintain position, sluggish to height, etc.) when one of the motors is greatly different than the other 3. If you connect to the WEB AP through any browser form a device connected to the drone (192.168.99.1) you can go to the System Status page, select the Motors tab, then send commands to each motor individually. I usually set mine to around 70% throttle for about 4 seconds, making sure the frame is secure in my grip. Send each motor a command and listen to the ‘hum’ or sound of the motor as it’s spinning. All 4 should be harmonicly close to each other. If one sounds really different than the other 3, then that one is probably the culprit. Hope that helps.  Matt "

37,Sky Viper Journey Pro Video GPS Drone V2700 -It's HERE!,35,Showing as in stock at Target!  *,"6 November, 2018 I am a big fan of the Sky Viper v2450GPS! I do not intend to sound negative in attempting to communicate experiences and suggest improvements with this drone. I have accumulated 478:54 minutes in 373 flights, reaching 234.4 feet altitude with my current 2450! My entire last flight is on video, and shows the 2450 holding position without moving. It is now tuned to hold a Learned Throttle Value of 0.3517%, which is an acceptable performance level in calm conditions. The fact that this drone can help to familarize one with Ardupilot, which I believe will play a significant role in the future of drones, is worth the price alone. If Sky Rocket offered aftermarket type upgrade parts for the Sky Viper, I’m sure I would continue flying it. Having a ready supply of all of it’s wear parts in stock would also make a real difference. I would upgrade the frame if a rigid, fiber reinforced Cycolac version were available. I sure folks would want to buy parts to upgrade their drone. I had to have been flying with upgraded props in order to get to 234.4 feet flying from a base altitude of 4200’ asl! Hopefully, a new, lighter, stiffer version with all the bells like GPS, barometer, AND flowhold is “on the horizon”. Brushed motors are still viable if well implemented, and the investment in the necessary   manufacturing and technology has already been made…  If the good folks at Sky Rocket, or anyone else for that matter, has any questions regarding the Sky Viper that I may be able to help with, feel free to LMK.

I have handled a 2700 and the plastic was shinier and more brittle (feeling) so you are probably right. If the main reduc gear on the 2700 is a different size than the 2450 as I have read, SR may have been trying to address the power to weight issue. My 2450 is now down due to this gear and I wonder if one should try the 2700 version(s) as I can’t find the 2450 version. Lesson very well learned. RESEARCH PRODUCT SUPPORT CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING IN THE FUTURE! I found websites that specialize in drone parts. They carried most other brands but had almost nothing for SV products. Also, I need to order and install bearings as my frame bushing to axle/reduc gear setup is getting sloppy and slow. This will obviously be a terminal problem that is already beginning to affect power transmission balance. Next? I may end getting a Pixhawk based 5.5"" or a brushless frame for the SV “board hack” done before I can get this bird flying again, which means that it’s original frame/motors would be done. Oh well, what a ($$$) pity. At least I won’t be clogging up this thread anymore. One CAN make use of the board, as this community has done a great job with that mod. Good luck with your SV. Keep it up! se p.s. my last (string) frame reinforcement setup was working very well by itself, without any other frame braces. This mod shows how good the SV can be.

37,Sky Viper Journey Pro Video GPS Drone V2700 -It's HERE!,48,Showing as in stock at Target!  *,"Hi Daquon, I hear your frustration and understand it. There are a myriad of factors for why things change between models. Last year there were several components that for one reason or another were climbing in price. Combine that with the buyers of the big retail chains saying “bring down the cost by a third, and we’ll increase our orders”. That’s the tightrope we have to walk each year. So when we have to find a way to make something perform equal to or better than the previous year, but cut the costs by whatever amount, changes like the motor mounts, different processor, etc. happen. Those mounts, even though per unit price is small, adds up fast. When you are looking at a million units, you need 4 million of those things, plus 4 million of the plug to go onto the motor leads. Again, wanting to keep our retail partners happy to hit the per-unit pricepoint means we have to lower the costs anyway we can. That’s how you have a $150 v2450GPS one year and a $99 Journey (that functions identical to the previous year) the next. It’s not always ideal, but that’s the business of it. If I had my way, I’d be shoving an OF sensor on a 2-cell Jouney, along with a 5.8 analog output for true FPV. By the way, since you asked about mods, I’d buy a FURY, wick the solder off of the OF sensor module and solder that onto the appropriate place on the Journey board. The FW will have to be compiled specifically for an OF/GPS combination (as it isn’t setup for that currently), but the OF code is in the base, at least. We designed the flight board of the Journey to allow for the OF sensor that’s on the SCOUT and FURY, initially. Sadly, the buyers didn’t see a value in it, since GPS was already there to ‘keep the drone in place’."

I don’t think there will be much more Sonix development since it currently meets our needs for the product. It really didn’t change too much between the 2017 and 2018 modules, apart from the sensor cable going from parallel to MIPI. The whole WebAP came about completely from Tridge. When we were waiting an extraoridinarily long time for the module supplier to get us the source code, Tridge got tired of waiting, kicked down the walls of the Sonix code and built up the WebAP for development purposes. It worked so well and was so helpful, we agreed to keep it in for release. SOOOOO glad we did, too! It’s helped us diagnose issues with Customer support as well as created an open door for the entire community who loves to tinker. It would have been an outright shame for the V2450GPS to ship with that firmware on it and not have an interface like the WebAP to work with it.  Matt "

Pull the parameter list in MissionPlanner and you’ll see what the RC/GCS failsafe behaviors are set to. Likely RTH or RTL.  Advice: Check the parameters, check the rates. Ensure you have let it sit outdoors on a table for 5-10min at least once to let the GPS get the almanac. Perform all the calibrations they list in the manual. Programmable Tx: I chose FlySky over FrSky for a number of reasons, and given their recent behavior I’m glad I have, though RTF/BNF support for FlySky isn’t the same as it is for FrSky, though it gets better by the day. I’d get anything that can run OpenTx that’s in your price range. People love the Jumper Tx units. I rather like my FlySky FS-i6 with the open-source community mod firmware. Logs will be very good to have. As an aside, don’t let the experience of a toy-grade brushed RTF miniquad that was liquidated for $40 at Target color your perception of ArduPilot (not disparaging the SkyViper units, they’re freaking phenomenal for the money and quite literally the only entry-level RTF kit I’ve ever seen running something as sophisticated as ArduPilot with a full set of sensors… Like a little brushed Solo.

This experience will give me much insight into what hardware to purchase in the future.

Despite being a toy-grade, the SkyViper is an incredibly complex piece of kit with a myriad of sensors… RTFM at least once. Let’s start with the basics: Did you do the two calibration dances? Does the manual even ask you for that? SD Card: Card going RAW after being written to isn’t a good sign. Could be bad host controller in the SkyViper (not likely), or bad/old card, as you’ve intimated. Toss that thing. Do you have a “shielded” area wherein you could do a hover test after letting it sit idle for a few minutes to get a solid lock? By shielded I mean not exposed to direct wind at or around ground level… Treed in yard? As for a hover test, you want to be out of ground-effect which will make it wobble in the dirty air from propwash… So try to hover at 6ft AGL or higher without going out of your “shielded” location. Try to stay away from buildings, canyon walls, etc. as that will cause GPS multipathing. Try to have a clear line of sight from the top of the SkyViper to the sky, so not under any overhangs."

I’ve also located another park which is smaller with better and thicker trees surrounding it which should give me better wind break than I saw today.  I’m hoping to get out there sometime this weekend.  It’s in the same municipality so it will be drone friendly… Today’s park would have been ideal for a small fixed wing.

I used one of my stock SVs, which Loitered well, as a baseline and compared the parameters with the one that didn’t. Granted, I had messed around with things like swapping the STM32 Flight Controller (I burned out the original) and binding to my Taranis radio (which was cool). So I went back to the stock transmitter, Toy Mode, and tried to compare the differences. The main differences are below:  COMPASS_AUTODEC should be 2 (undocumented, WiKi has 0 or 1) for the automatic calculation of the declination based on gps location. COMPASS_LEARN should be 2 for EKF-Learning COMPASS_PMOT_EN should be 1 for enabling per-motor compass correction.  Sometimes I made multiple changes at once, which is not good for testing isolation, but it is winter here and I literally fly out of my house in Alt. Hold mode and then switch to Loiter in the backyard for testing. Crazy, huh? In addition to setting the parameters above (not sure what COMPASS_AUTODEC set to 2 does, perhaps anything non-0 is the same as 1) I realized that the SV uses COMPASS_PMOT_EN set to 1. So I raised the GPS module above the case and re-calibrated the compass using the Onboard Mag Calibration routine successfully. Again, I made multiple changes at once. On my first flight in the backyard using LOITER mode, I could literally see the hover get better and better! It went from toilet bowl to a solid hover! After a minute or two, my SV hovered just fine as if it was fresh out of the box."
40,SkyViper Scout Killed by the App,0,"Hey all. Sorry if this is already addressed elsewhere but after pairing a new Scout with the app, the drone will no longer respond to the controller. I have not installed any updated firmware: everything should be factory stock. I’m not sure if it’s relevant but I had some difficulty getting the app pairing to work - failing on an iPhone 7 (I could connect to the drone’s wifi but could never get past the “Connect to your drone’s wifi” screen on the app) before finally succeeding on an old Asus Android tablet. As mentioned, after getting the app to work, the drone would no longer respond to the controller. On a second iPhone 7, I opened up the SkyViper Web Server and was able to verify that all the drone’s sensors are still working, the camera is working, the motors are working, that the controller is paired, and the drone is recognizing when I move the sticks and press the buttons. I believe that all phones/tablets have been disconnected from the drone’s wifi but could multiple connections cause the drone to no longer respond to the controller? How can the drone simultaneously register the controller button/stick movements (on the Web Server) and yet not act on those by flying? Any help would be appreciated.",

After doing a factory reset,  the drone lights returned so I did a calibration and it seemed to work.  All motors spin and the motor,magnetometer calibration seemed normal but now the drone will lift only a few inches from the ground,  probably limited to ground effect altitude. I have tried using the more extended calibration routines within Mission planner which include calibrating the transmitter stick range.  Nothing seems to help.

Be careful doing this test for obvious reasons. This test would rule out any calibration problems that would cause the quad to not want to lift up. If the quad still does not lift up it may be because they are designed to operate at a higher voltage than the Sky Viper original motors were. For that there might not really be an easy way to cope with that."

Time to disassemble  and melt those 2 decent joints I manged to finally  get to form. The super small wires are so small it’s next to impossible for me to do any thing with them due to badl hand tremor  . Thank God for wife’s help . Reversed wires and it’s airborne inside all appears good after I  quick calibrated  and did a fixed manometer calibration .  Weathers turned back to cold and  to breezy to try out doors yet . Maybe tomorrow.  I have photos I’ll try and post in case they help some other person .[Preformatted text](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hs0ICedfGRrn3SRf1)*"

There are no other markings on them so It is impossible to be sure.  I needed to replace the left front motor (red and blue wires) and the first one worked for only a few flights before failing to a half bad state such that it would spin but had less than half of the required power.  I replaced it with the second motor from the set and it seems fine after several flights.  It was the suggestion from RUSTBOX to use a 100 setting on the motor test which revealed the lack of power."

It resulted inability to flight against wind or unexpected early landing etc. Got CL-0820-15 motors from Micro Motor Warehouse and replaced all. It is very well documented. I got a cheaper one from HobbyKing but gave up as I could not identify which is CW and CCW. MMW has a few kvs. Not sure which, picked up middle to low one. Replacement was straight forward, can finish in one hour. My MMW motor came with shorter wires and 11T pinion. I simply cut and soldered to existing SV motor wire, replaced pinion with SVs 13T one.(push on) Marked motors rotation direction CW and CCW according to MMW photo. Also marked SVs motor as well. (Front Right motor is CW, for example) MMW motor polarity is also documented well. SVs motor wires are Red-Blue and Red-White. Red is plus and rest are minus. If you are not sure, SV Web I/F, System -> Motor testing function was handy to test each motor. Disassemble SV, unscrew 8 + 2 + 2 screws to remove bottom battery holder, bottom white part. It may not be necessary to remove flight board. Lift SV arm black plastic part to remove.  Now motor can be removed by pushing from pinion gear side. Cut motor wire, and solder to MMW motor, cover soldering part with shrink tube. Assemble arm, careful to route wires well. Screw back. Done! Probably I should break-in these brushed motors, but I skipped…This is indoor flight log after replacement. it shows SV can hover well with no excessive throttle till 3.3V. Satoru"

I just listened to your talk, “More Crazy Flying Machines,” from LinuxConfAu 2018 where near the end you mentioned soldering on this very board. Can you provide more details about the 3 pins going to the “debug console”? I can indeed see that the black wire is connected to ground, and the other two wires are connected to transmit and receive. Are the voltages on these pins fully RS-232, TTL (5V), or CMOS (3.3V)? I will assume 3.3V and work my way up from there. Is there a schematic that would answer this question? And lastly, is this “debug console” useful for debugging with GDB, JTAG, or something else? UPDATE: I will find out what can I learn on my own and report my findings back to this thread. Andrew, you really have already provided all the important details between your talk and this post. I’ve never used GDB on an embedded system. This is going to be so much fun!

On certain remote targets, you can use an auxiliary program gdbserver instead of linking a stub into your program. See section Using the gdbserver program, for details.

ESC firmware is Simonk. 5 inch prop.  This quad motor is for 3s battery, prepared cheap regulator. Gave up voltage monitoring. I have not updated firmware to master. As is out of the box. Will use default toy TX. Can use Web interface parameter menu.  Solder wires to 4 FETS and ground.  Wire to pin terminal for 4 ESCs.  Fix flight board somehow, done. Weighs 310g without battery…  Calibrated 4 ESCs with servo tester, changed MOT_PWM_TYPE to 0, (have not changed RC_SPEED…) Verified it can arm and motor spins correctly on bench using Web interface and Mission Planner. I needed to lower PID values as minimum as possible in Mission Planner. Once it can fly, I ran autotune. Attaching log file which was able to do short auto mission. "

I am considering a camera system like the Runcam Split Mini, which, if I am correct, would handle the wifi and sdhc requirements. I will look into the Logging function.

I set one for 4 volts to power the boards.  I used another for a 5 volt reference since my ESCs don’t include a BEC. The 5 volt reference is used for this handy level shifter because my ESCs also don’t reliably work with the 2.8 volt PWM signal put out by the controller board. As long as I’m here, a few other things I’ve learned and some pictures: The 10 inch props on this old frame make a lot of vibration in the Z direction.  Suspending the controller from the 3 mounting holes with elastic bands neatly solves the vibration problem for little additional weight. Mount the GPS well away from the RF noise of the controller, camera and the fields of the motor and power wires.  Don’t forget to do a full calibration of the sensors, including motor mag field calibration. The foam over the pressure sensor is important. Heat shrink tubing works well to stiffen the antennas (upper right of photo) if you want to point them up. I extended the LED wires to place them (pointing down) under the motors. I’m still working on a better way to mount the camera to avoid the nasty vibration on this large frame."

It helps avoid moving air over the sensor from disturbing the reading due to the lower pressure of moving air. The GPS is receiving and correlating very weak signals and it is sensitive to RF noise which processors and radios make.  the compass built into the GPS board also benefits from the extra distance from the magnetic fields generated by the power and ESC wires.  The SV is so small that there isn’t much choice on GPS placement.  They have pointed out that they used a fairly high quality GPS receiver.  It is possible that the higher quality and cost was justified because it is so close to noise sources.  GPS does seem to work just a little better on the original frame after I added some additional shielding.  I posted about the shield I added to the SV frame a few months ago if you care to search for it."

I had to wait for some generic ones to arrive to replace but once I did they spun smooth again. It would fly with the cracked ones but they were noisier and shakier than the others.

46,V2700 not connecting to android GCS's,1,I am unable to connect my V2700 to any other GCS for android other than SV 2.0.  All firmware is updated.  on QGC connection is never established and on MP the app crashes after hitting connect.  I set them up on UDP at 14550.  I am able to connect via PC just fine.  I haven’t changed to MAV link 1 since everything i have read suggests that the newest versions of the apps are able to use MAV 2.  I really want to use either of these apps as the map view on SV2.0 is trash and has a short list of available functions.  Thank You.,"This: * will show you how to turn connection loggin which may be of some help. Last time I tried QGC with a SkyViper (not sure what model it was, someone sent me one to test with) it worked without needing any changes onthe SkyViper end."

The Sky Viper series has had numerous improvements leading to some additional flight weight. I believe that the 2450 (2018 model as evidenced by the new prop guards and picture quality) and 2700 motor failures I have experienced are due to the lower air density here (temperature and turbulence as well) combined with the new model weight increase. The prop guards, (which I don’t use due to performance loss) have been redesigned, I believe for this reason. At times the drone seems to be barely able to maintain altitude/position. Does anyone know of a solution for a high(er) altitude environment? Other manufacturers offer different propellers, but I was also wondering if a change in gear ratio could compensate for 15% thinner air? Thanks!"

These brushed motors just aren’t very durable, and that’s just the nature of the technology really. Perhaps props which make better use of the available air are a better bet. You might even be able to find motors which have more power, but I think these little guys are probably on the edge of the performance you can get at that size and weight. I also have seen some threads where people are successfully integrating ESCs and Brushless into this model.  That’s an option for more power. But this thread shows it on a new frame… *  Good luck finding something that works"

For the Sky Viper v2450gps version, anyway, the motors are indeed at their limit. I have seen the stock setup wind down in as little as 2 hours flight time! I am looking for recommendations on new brushed motor options. Possibly the Micro Motor Warehouse or other 8.5x20mm varieties (that maybe are a bit more economical than $27.00 p/set for the MMW’s?). What rpm is the current model using? I believe that I’m seeing 1760rpm @ a learned hover of 53.17% meaning a maximum motor speed of 17k? Are the actual numbers listed somewhere? Upgrading to a new prop (one that doesn’t flex?) has helped tremendously. The new props are significantly quieter. Autotune mode shows much less bounce and f/c corrections are more precise. Position hold “wander” is reduced by orders of magnitude. Rate of climb and more importantly controlled decent are similarly improved. Although top speed is only slightly higher, the drone gets there much quicker. “Bullnose” profile props appear to provide all the additional surface area needed to compensate for lower altitude density. Adding a third blade ended up not being as necessary but still makes for an impressive acceleration upgrade that I am going to stay with (Gemfan 5550 bn3b). Autotune’s 1""-2""  bumps become 3""-5"" jumps at a cost of about 5%-7% flight duration. Dropping to a 13t pinion may be necessary at this point to ease motor load (i.e. longevity) and potentially extend flight duration a bit. Again, knowing the design rpm considerations for the motor/propeller on this drone would be most helpful. Am I going to have to throw a $30.00 set of 17k motors at this thing? Thanks, SE"

They are quiet, smooth,  fairly fast and have great control authority. The Gemfan 5550 3 blade bullnose are hard to come by and expensive ($4.00 p/pair @ B&H). They pull too much air and require an 11t pinion to calm the SV down. That setup though, is the fastest, makes a bit more noise and are “wilder” than the Cyclones. I tried some Gemfan Wind Dancer 5042’s, they do not generate sufficient thrust and allow the motors to overspin. Speaking of motors, the factory jobs are not up to the task for the heavier v2450/2700 and slowly died after less than 2 hours f.t. I found some Crazypony motors for $20.95/8 on eBay. Although they sound as if they are not spinning as fast, they appear to have more torque than stock. The leads were too short and they all spun ccw, but after some soldering, I couldnt be happier. The Viper’s personality is so much better with these motors. In retrospect, I would probably go with the Micro Motor Warehouse 17 or 18k (“insane speed”) motors equipped with long 11t pinion gears (not the MMW versions).  I am starting a new build project and didn’t want to spend the $27.00 plus. That was probably a mistake as those motors will likely bring the SV’s t/w up to an even more acceptable level. That being said, the CrazyPonies are definately a big step in the right direction! Go little Viper, go!!! What a great project! Good luck and N’Joy, SteveE"

I knew my frame was flexing, getting softer and taking a beating, just not how much this affects every single aspect of performance. As a result, I will doubtless avoid injection molded frames in the future… …so now what? I was measuring for some braces I’m building to try and straighten/stiffen the frame. How to hold the frame in place to get proper measurements? Bingo! The same way the Sky Viper will fly from now on! $0.45 worth of Spectra kite line carefully wrapped around, and pulling in on the motor lowers completely firms up the frame like a bow and string and brings the motors back into alignment. “Literally Night & Day” (sorry, had to). The frame is now as stiff as a new 4mm carbon X race. My v2450 can now (position) hold completely still. Really! For an entire charge, even with a bit of breeze/turbulence.

The kitchen sink slip jaw pliers solved my other problem, power robbing gear lash. Turns out the reduction gear/prop mount was slowly slipping off of the shaft, which was then easy to bend. A gentle squeeze. Very Gentle, and full performance restored, even newly realized. How do I start a new “string” for this frame fix? Please repost! Good Luck with your Sky Vipers, folks.

Look closely at his pic and you will see a washer-system fashioned at the screwhead of the prop. I’ve used flat head screws before that look like they have a washer built into the screwhead. The screw diameter of the toothed screw is a M2.5 or M3, I believe… not 100% on that, though. I’ve made a few of these around the shop before, but please be aware that you are slinging a LOT more plastic and the Brushed motors don’t like the extra strain. Brushed motors will degrade faster when they are taxed with more torque. Motor tests with differing prop setups on 20 motors sets on the bench saw a motor life drop to about 1/5 of what we needed when slinging the 3 prop blades. When it works, it’s GREAT, but expect to replace motors often."

It is actually designed around the same props. The ones you see are Gemfan 5550 bn3bl. They came from B&H but were expensive and slow. I’ve seen them elsewhere on the Goog, USA site for half. I also found that the Dalprop Cyclone 5544 works if you need a low gear or likely a better option at sea level, very quiet and precise. They are 3 blade as well. I have also ordered bearings and both 11 tooth and 13 tooth gears to experiment with! With the Gemfans, my Learned Hover Throttle dropped from 52% to 31.15%, a dramatic improvement. I have also swithched to Crazypony 0820 motors that spin slower but have more torque and accel while lasting at least 5 hours @ (8/$22.00, some soldering). Hence ordering the 13t pinions. Last, Micro Motor Warehouse has motors from 14k-18k. I’d like to experiment with 17k & 11t. Stock props have way too much flex, esp. camber, and make too much (inefficient) noise. Good Luck! se Oh, and also, I used about .4mm of 2mm id silicone fuel hose as an expansion washer, It sticks up maybe  0.1-0.2mm above prop hub. Close fitting 2mm i.d. flat washer is key, as it compresses tubing which locks up against the inside of the prop. Good eye."

The Spectra string (important, zero stretch) harness was created to line up the thrust angles on the sagging frame in order to measure for and build the struts you saw. It became the better brace system. I built the longitudinal struts before realizing that the frame was now already fully triangulated and as strong and stiff as my 3mm carbon fiber frame! The key is the 3 way swivel, which aligns the pull along the leg, and could easily be duplicated with other hardware or knots. This brace counteracts the tendency of the legs to sag towards the center with use (thrust lines converge, rolly poly holdy) The struts I designed using the prop guard mounts tend to obstruct the camera and impose a much greater aerodynamic load, IMO. I’m trying to build an 1106 brushless motor version of the factory frame that will eventually depend on string, I’m sure! In addition to the string, I may use the thin tubing and route the string through it for a clean setup that uses both tension and compression for better strength. Combine this with the struts to better locate the motors within the thrust plane if using more powerful motors. The full bracing setup may hold up to much more powerful motors that could easily fit atop the gear housing on the stock motor mount. Like 2207s!! Notice the battery holder mod? Ready for a 12 mm or 15 mm thick lipo (2000+mah) or a 2s pack! Best Luck, se "

Build a good formula to convert for altitude. My experience has been that a simple percentage adjustment is inadequate, especially when Reynolds numbers relating to very small props creeps in.

If you lose 15% thrust performance due to altitude and heat, from where the design was tested, it seems that an off-the-shelf quad can go from efficient to unflyable very quickly!

Quick recap- I live at 4400’msl and at 90+f and 15% rh, many oem toy grade are at their limits here. The Sky Viper is an example. The Gemfan 5555 3bl bullnose draw too much without dropping to an 11t pinion, then they are much better. Guessing that they would be way too much at sea level. The 5044 Wind dancers, even with a 13t pinion, were still a bit limp. For here, something like the 5555 code red 2-blade by gemfan seem to be the best choice without changing ratio. Also the stock motors…    …maybe 14k on a good day. Simple and cheap upgrades are everywhere (mmw’s are great, crazypony’s are cheap, and you can select rpm). Find the long gear on the pinions due to slop, the bearing upgrade may be the best thing for the 2450! I would try the code reds at sea level as going 3 blade is better left to more powerful brushless applications, imo. Which is why I have gone over to the dark side… …Here’s an example of my latest experiments. Now that we have access to the DJI f/c…   As you can see, 4 different sets.

Looks like this requires more work to fly well.  RC radio connection is better. I just need to wait longer to get it connected, no need to bind every time. Relocated GPS to the side to get better connection. Having tough time with ‘Bad AHRS’. On most flights, I get ‘Bad AHRS’ message, when flew (with disabling dependency check), control are frozen in FBWA, FBWB, RTL mode. On the ground servos are working to correct direction in those modes, but there is no movement in the flight when I switch to them. GPS is good, vibration is not much. Tried to disable compass but no go. Checking (or learning to check) data logs further. Also started to check ChibiOS thread and gitter as this is new on-going development.  Looks like this takes longer to finish but having fun."

Thanks! -Matt PS forgot to mention, the sky viper I am using is the V2450GPS.","Hi Loic, Funny that I should first see this thread just 8 hours after you asked if an answer was ever found by Matthew (mdomanic). I was wondering the same thing. I have 3 Sky Viper Journeys that I would like to control with my own home-grown GCS (writing from the ground up in C#, a fledgling work-in-progress). I’m to the point now where I have 3 wifi adapters on my PC connected to the respective drones, receiving UDP packets (which I am able to make Mavlink sense of) but similar to Matthew’a case, all the remote IPEndPoint objects that I read off my UDP datagram socket say 192.168.99.1. I see no way to easily configure the drones to use a different subnet (e.g., change drones 2 and 3 to use 192.168.100.1 and 192.168.101.1 instead of 192.168.99.1). So my latest theory is that I may need to build my own ardupilot firmware .abin files with the subnet tweaks, and load those in my 2nd and 3rd drones. Disclaimer: I am not a drone expert. Very much a newcomer to this. On the bright side, I am a professional programmer with 30+ years of programming experience, including writing communication software (back in the 80’s, but concepts are still the same), so I am cheerfully (naively?) optimistic I can figure this out. If I have a break-thru, I’ll write back on this thread. Oh…I meant to add that I looked at your reference link regarding the Antenna Tracker. Seems like an overly complicated solution to me. I mean, each drone can report its GPS coordinate just fine, right? So all the GCS needs is to be able to distinguish between them. Hence, I’ll continue researching my custom firmware idea to tweak the subnet used by each Sky Viper. Wish me luck."

Add to this , a pre-configured flow that sends pictures to the Watson Visual Recognition service to classify what is in the image, makes it really easy to anyone interested to try , and get hooked to Watson as the preferred AI cloud service. How about ArduPilot and Skyviper ?  Well, actually you could use the IBM image classifier workflow, but you would need to control the drone with Mission Planner (or DroneKit Python) using GPS coordinates outdoor. Implementing control within code-RED requires a considerable effort and at the moment, none of the actual ArduPilot compatible drones offers a vision systems that can precisely controlled indoor (or outdoor no wind).

I think I had to register for a cloud account and complete one of their Watson Vision tutorials to complete the entry, maybe I’ll win one…  BUT, I would  much rather do this type of programming and learning on an Ardupilot capable drone, so then I remembered the Skyviper is an Ardupilot based craft.  How do the various Skyvipers compare to the Tello? is there a similar development environment ? Rusty","Yes there is a SkyViper with  OpticalFlow (Scout) that offers a velocity estimator that can reduce vehicle drift, but  the Trello has an absolute localization system in the sense that you can send position (distances x-y) commands (as a GPS in Auto Mode). Blocky is similar to Scratch and node-RED is an IoT framework with a Scratch Wrapper."
63,How to autonomously trigger a servo/device onboard Sky Viper,0,"Hi all, I just bought and received my first Sky Viper Journey – haven’t even flown it yet! – and I have spent the better part of last week (and the beginning of this one…) researching various topics related to autonomous flight and operations on multi-rotors, Sky Vipers specifically as the week progressed. I intend to use the Sky Viper as a research platform for autonomous swarms to deliver payloads during wildfires (supplies, fire retardant,…) and while it seems the Sky Viper will fit the bill for most of that (the research part, not the actual application), I am hitting a limitation: I would need to trigger the payload autonomously as part of the mission planning and that’s where I fall short. Note: I do not intend to use or test this in populated areas but as mentioned as a R&D platform for a potential project at my startup I also realize that the Viper will not be able to lift more than a few grams, really interested in the framework itself I chose to start with the Viper because at this price point, it won’t be too painful to purchase a few to experiment with swarming but the absence of a full blown pixhawk (seems to) make it complicated to hook up a companion computer, and thus operate the payload. It seems the *, but I don’t know if it could be used to send some current to the servo/device for a moment. Any advice or thoughts? To play around, I bought this * from Amazon, comes with its own receiver and battery and is triggered by a remote. It could be taken apart and powered by the Viper’s battery directly, if I could find a way to use the CC – or anything else – as a trigger. * is servo-less and plugs into the receiver, but AFAIK, I can’t do so on the Viper (?) Or are there empty channels I could use/plug into? I am obviously welcoming any other ides on how to achieve the goal  Cheers!",

Curious, I opened the tx and surprised to find the antenna a separate item from the main controller board with a connector just as an internal laptop wireless card. It attaches to a small flat board probably with the same copper traces all other toy drone tx boards use. (Foam tape holds it to inside of tx) The fake plastic antenna is removable and appears a flat piece of plastic could be cut to fit and a 2.4ghz dipole added. I haven’t tried a mod yet as I can build and fix electronic boards but have very little knowledge of antenna. In thinking about it, wireless cards in a laptop have a primary and secondary wire that run up to and around the LCD screen. I may try removing the wire from a old laptop, connect it in the tx, make a light weight “X” frame the size of the screen and wrap the wire around it.

Using freshly charged NiMH batteries or new alkaline batteries I was always having RTH kick in at a range of about 120’. I have the BRD_RADIO_TXMAX set to 7, so I will try again at 8. FPV to the app also failed at around this distance. I was looking at the RSSI number from the DATAFLASH. I was wondering what other users see as typical RSSI for a given distance?"

71,Motor Pinion & Prop Gear Sloppy Mesh Fix with Bonus,1,SV started making a weird sound and so after inspection found one pinion/prop shaft had developed excessive lash.

The pinion gear had started to wear in the middle so had to slide it approx. 1mm further down the motor shaft . * * * Bonus: While in there I lubed the prop shaft and bearing with grease using a FREE dosage syringe from my local grocery pharmacy. *,Something else I’ve found . . . the factory applied grease is clear and rather thin and it gets thrown around the inside of the gearcase and when it does it’s black which tells me the metal propshaft or bearing is wearing prematurely which can lead to excessive gear clearance.

The pinion gear had started to wear in the middle so had to slide it approx. 1mm further down the motor shaft . * * * Bonus: While in there I lubed the prop shaft and bearing with grease using a FREE dosage syringe from my local grocery pharmacy. *,It’s smaller than the v2450 ( pinion gear)

Top side under the big gear. When you drill the hole for the bearing seat it should be only deep enough to fit the bearing. I drilled one of them too deep and it still worked ok. To deep and you are removing material you need for prop shaft support. I used the non-flange bearing. I bought flange bearings also, but they are not a good solution because of the flange. Be careful. The bit will want to dig into the plastic. As I drilled the bushing came out the other side, but I had to push out a couple of them. So you can remove the bushing and shorten it to make up for the bearing. You need enough bushing to support the c-clip end of the shaft. Cut slightly more than the depth of the bearing and re-insert until flush at the bottom. Try to get a good finish on the bushing since the drilling and cutting tends to rough it up and deform it. I used a dremel tool to cut the bushing to length. There was no change in flying time, but it is quieter and has less vibration. Good luck.

Off topic: I have more than one of the v2450GPS that have unstable yaw. Even when sitting still. View the web page System Status-IMU and the yaw is counting up or down especially after making a move. This causes the drone to rotate while in flight. In a short time it will move 10 to 30 degrees so stick actions become confusing. The only work around I can imagine is going to Super Simple Mode. Any ideas? Thanks,  Tim"

When you say “sitting still/making a move” you mean while hovering? Do you get the same fluctuation in readings when it is on the ground? I noticed one of my quads arms vibrating excessively while hovering (bent prop shaft). The stability of the sensors seems quite vulnerable to vibration, and the hold performance (all sensors) has improved after straightening/balancing and bracing the arms with a strut system. Oh, and after getting through all mag/accel calibration. n’joy! se p.s I do understand about drilling plastic, as I once sold and repaired HDPE sea kayaks. Yes on the press if can. Step Drill? Three fluted bit? Dremel w/grinder bit? Or most likely, carve it out with an Xacto knife?!? I’ll let you know what seems to work out best. Thanks again."

As to yaw instability the answer is yes to both your questions. When unarmed you can see the yaw data moving either negative or positive while the viper sits still or if you move it by hand the yaw data keeps moving even after the viper is still. While hovering this yaw instability is translated as constant slow rotation. This rotation also occurs while flying which really screws with your head since you assume it’s flying straight. As this yaw happens the pitch and roll orientation swap from the pilot point of view. I like the viper, but it’s not robust. I think the high temp camera board under the main board is cooking the IMU."

77,Journey using 5V,1,"Anyone know if the boards in the Journey can be powered via 5V (BEC)? I mostly care about the GPS and Sonix board. It seems like 5V is not much higher than max 1S voltage, so I wouldn’t think it would be a problem, but I don’t see a a regulator on the GPS board, so I’m a bit hesitant to just try it. I may have missed it, or the vreg may be under the can… I see what appears to be several vregs on the Sonix board. Yes, I did pop the can if anyone want to see pictures. It looks pretty similar to the v2450 board. I purchased a used “for parts” Journey to play with, and was wondering how hard it would be to put some or all of the parts in, say, a fixed wing.","To answer my own question, all the boards appear to support 5V with no problem. The GPS does appear to have a 3.3V regulator, since the voltage at the mag stays at 3.3V no matter the input voltage, which makes sense. I can’t guarantee that nothing is going to fail at 5V, but I would expect that the regulators should be able to handle 5V without problem, since they have to be able to handle > 4V already to support max 1S. I don’t know of any 3.3V regulator that doesn’t handle at least 6V."

Nothing wrong with the stock transmitter… I see, you have a Journey and no Transmitter. Try eBay.You are going to spend quite a bit of money on a radio and module to get that $100 craft flying. Maybe sell it and buy a new Journey? If you want a radio to grow into and use with the Journey a Taranis QX7 would be a good choice. Then you will have to spend another $35 for the module.

I assume this combination could be added to OpenTx, but AFIK, the Frsky protocol is usually used with the CC2500 radio. Assuming my assumptions are correct, should it be possible to fly using Mavlink over WiFi?"

If so, it might have smashed into a tree and be up there. If it lost Radio it should have RTH.  The only reason it would not RTH is if it lost GPS, then it would have just landed right where it is (but it would have been carried by the wind)  If you still have the log on GQC (and it stayed connected after it went astray), you should be able to tell what mode it went into and look at the compass values to at least see kinda what direction it drifted?

85,Flyaways . . . post your horror story,7,"So that others may learn from the experience, and take corrective action.","Hmm… that shouldn’t have happened. If you take-off before you have a GPS lock it’ll just remain in Alt-Hold mode until it gets a lock, at which point itll set the home point to the current location (wherever you are currently hovering) and switch to Loiter.  Actually this is an added feature of Toy_mode, that the normal AP master doesn’t have. The more likely scenario is you “thought” you had GPS stabilizing the drone, yet it was in Alt-Hold mode, so it wasn’t, and you didn’t control it to keep it in place. I’m not bashing on your flying skills, just pointing out that if you’re expecting the Flight Controller to be keeping it in place and it isn’t, then it’ll certainly fly away on it’s own. Even in Loiter, you always want to keep your fingers on the sticks in case you get a huge gust of wind (which the SV surprisingly handles well) or you become a victim of lot’s of multi-pathing (which the EKF only handles for a VERY short amount of time)"

After losing 3 main rotor e-clips, in flight, on different rotors at different times . . . I have started putting a drop of hot glue on the clips to prevent this. Luckily I was able to locate the gear and prop every time.  It also seems to help if you add a second 2mm flat washer to the propshaft, one above the bearing and one below the bearing. There is quite a bit of slack in the stock configuration and adding a second washer takes up most of this and prevents any hammering of the e-clip when the props spool up.

Meanwhile, one thing to try might be the Motor test tab in the WebAP interface? Try setting the hover value at around 60, bump up the duration to about 5 seconds, and spin up each motor individually, letting each of the motors spin on their own. A lot of times you can find one arm in particular being pretty nasty this way. From there it’s usually an issue of horribly balanced props (and they can be brand new props and be badly off-balance… we do our best, but cranking out 4 million of an item will have a few bad ones int he batches), or bent shaft pins like mentioned above.

90,New Journey Remote Questions,1,I have a new Journey and believe I am having trouble with the remote.  When powered on it alternates between red and green under the GPS and alternates between the 2 greens under normal and sport.  The Skyviper 2 app doesn’t see the remote but connects to the drone fine.  Is there any trick to make this connect or does my remote have a problem. Thanks,"Sound like remote may have a problem. The behavior you describe means that the TX isn’t paired to the drone. Try powering them both up, and set them down very close to each other. Let them sit for awhile, as after a minute or two, the frame will try to pair with any available close-by signal. Sounds like one of your antenna (either TX or Flight Board) might be loose. If possible, I’d return it to where you bought it for a replacement. If that isn’t possible, try reaching out to the Customer Support team at Skyrocket. They are finally getting out from under the Holiday slam and should be able to help you quickly."

I’m not the expert on fixing that problem but it involves simply setting up a serial connection over the WiFi AP to the SONIX and resetting some values.  Have you been playing with settings or changing things? Just curious, or did it “just stop working”?  If you’re getting video that means that the SONIX hasn’t gone bad, so I’ll just assume that the baudrate has been changed and it needs to be reset.  With the Tx not binding, that is unrelated to the SONIX.  It connects directly to the Flight controller.  I suppose there is a chance that the Flight controller isn’t booting properly.   Perhaps your VERY first effort is to * after you do that, you may find that everything is working. Follow the instructions carefully! If Factory Reset doesn’t work, then * using the “Load with the SD card” method. That’s pretty easy. It is possible to “brick” the flight controller, but it is totally unbrickable because the SONIX has proven to be very reliable, and all of these reset and loading methods are performed by the SONIX board. For all troubleshooting and developer stuff look here: * You’re bound to find some info there that’ll help including the serial connection to the board, and tricks to bind the transmitter."

Probably you will need to change value directly at Mission Planner full parameter menu, (or Sky Viper Web Flight Parameter menu if you have not updated Sky Viper firmware to master.), because you may need to set value lower than we can set through Mission Planner extended tuning menu. 1, Try to set minimum value you can set at Mission Planner extended tuning menu. Rate P, I, D, and see you will not see fast oscillation. 2, If * is not enough, change ATC_RAT_xx value directly with MP full parameter or SV parameter menu. Once copter is flyable, you can proceed to auto tuning to refine. See * on conversion, I have attached DataFlash log of my similar sized quad. Open it with * or something, check ATC_RAT_xx values. Be careful when you do auto tune. SV transmitter range is very short. I lost my first one fly away on windy day… Satoru"

Another thing to consider regarding the throttle and ESC calibration fun… in the V2450GPS transmitter, the sticks bump against the round plastic edges before you can get to a ‘true’ zero throttle. Since they are round, you also can’t do a true ‘down and to the left’ movement with the sticks. While we were able to adjust for that in the parameters and work around it, if you are moving these boards to different frames and hardware you will bump into this issue. Maybe try removing the top half of the TX casing when doing ESC calibration? Check the throttle values via the WebAP or in a ground station program to see what actual value you are seeing from the throttle travel. And yes… being on these new motors will absolutely mean you will need new PIDs and throttle values. Hope that helps. Good luck and Fly Safe!"

95,Skyviper jounery motor replacment?,1,hi guys just got the journey for Christmas having so much fun with it but crashed pretty hard and broke one of the teeth on the motor gear. Do you guys think I should order new motors from skyviper? or I was thinkining about buying after market brushless motors and modding them in would that be possible? I’m handy with a soldering iron thanks in advance for any help you could offer?,Just replace the brushed motor. To go brushless would require 1S ESC’s for them. Then figure out where the control signals are on the board and then some configuration changes in Arducopter. It would be a Kluge. Check out the V2450GPS threads there is some discussion about it there.

That said, if the FC was disconnected from the SONIX, but still powering up (and booting) you’d still be able to use the Tx, but in the case where the SONIX cannot communicate with the FC, then the Force Bind method wouldn’t be working."

The Sonix does really weird things if the battery is not strong enough to power it.  Is it an old battery? Even if charged, it may not be putting out adequate voltage for the Sonix to power up. If the Sonix IS powering up, and you are getting a wifi Access Point from it, then follow the usual instructions for updating the Flight Controller. If you’re NOT getting the Wifi Access Point, it is probably the battery…the general thought from the skyviper folks is the Sonix is (almost) un-brickable. And since the entire drone’s firmware is loaded through the Sonix interface, that is a good thing. All instructions for loading the firmware are located here: * The instructions for the 2450 and the Journey (2700) are the same…just make sure you use the correct version of firmware.  Also, be sure to name the files correctly as specified within the html. if you’re trying to force load the Flight controller, you have to rename the file to flight_fw.abin as * said."

We were hoping the battery would help speed along the lock procedure but in initial tests and evaluations the modules were the same with signal and lock acquisition between the two models. Both from cold start to a quick restart. In talks with the module dev team, they admitted that the battery ‘didn’t have to be there’ but since we were happy with similar lock time as the previous year (and ever tightening production schedules) we didn’t have time to explore if it was worse without it, so we kept it as is.

99,Battery specs for SkyvViper v2450gps,1,"So I tried a larger battery to see if I could get 5, 10 minutes more flight time. I picked a 2300mAh lipo off of Amazon, that didn’t have the discharge specs listed, but it was cheap so whatever.

But you’ll want to look for C rating and Internal Resistance Rating. C = The C Rating is simply a measure of how fast the battery can be discharged safely and without harming the battery. IR = is a measure of the difficulty a battery has delivering its energy to your motor It’s likely the IR is really high on those cheep batteries, so when the motors come on they draw so much power that the flight board drops below 3V, which causes it to shut off. Source here: * That probably doesn’t help you find “good batteries” but I think your best bet is to NOT order from Amazon. It’ll almost always be junk.  You’ll need to visit, or web browse, a hobby shop then make the connectors yourself."

The 2700 introduced an idea of “profiles” which likely will make much of the modification you want to do unnecessary. They have a sport profile and such. That will be much faster. Not sure if tridge programmed in an acro mode, but that is the ultimate, but of course very difficult. Regardless I believe tridge also made it so you can set the profiles how you wish. So, for example, you can set a profile to switch between brake and sport, so you can practice sport mode, and switch to brake mode in an emergency.  There is a lot to play with. To access, connect your device to the skyvipers wifi then log into the WebAP 192.168.1.1 Then click flight parameters to change. WARNING: changing parameters can make it unflyable. So be careful.

I fly for over 5 minutes after the low battery beeping comes on and have the camera running the whole time I think but I’m only getting a couple minutes recording out of the camera.

The 2450HD (black frame, non-GPS) uses Cleanflight, while the 2450GPS (white frame, GPS) uses ArduCopter. This last year we brought ArduCopter over to the Journey (white, GPS), Scout (Black, No GPS, but with Optical Flow) and Fury (Black, no GPS, but with Optical Flow). For the card, you don’t need a high-speed card as it’s 720p video and not a 100Mbps 4K feed like the $1k models. Just make sure it’s formatted to FAT filesystem. And yes, the recording stops when the critical battery alarm starts. I think what’s happening here is that due to the temperature, the LiPo is having issues. I remember flying at Lake Tahoe in 20 degree (F) weather and only made it 2:30 minutes. The cold slams the battery efficiency hard, but as it’s being used, it heats up. Because of this, I think you are seeing the crit voltage being triggered, but the internal heat is keeping the voltage juuuuust high enough to keep flying. The instructions sound wrong… which manual or instruction sheet was that from? I’ll see if it needs correcting. Thanks! Matt"
102,Regarding drone transmission power,1,"Hi, Could anybody please tell if a drone transmits more power or its controller? Regards, Avigyan.","I think it may be more complex in some cases. The Journey SV2700 also transmits back. It sends streaming video and telemetry about compass direction, onboard battery level etc. On this same area of discussion - what does the network looks like when I am using the controller, my phone and the drone? Do each have an IP address (i.e. 3 addresses)?"
102,Regarding drone transmission power,2,"Hi, Could anybody please tell if a drone transmits more power or its controller? Regards, Avigyan.","No.  The controller does not have an IP address, nor WIFI.  It communicates only with the radio chip on the flight controller board inside the drone and only using the DSM family of RC protocols. In case you were also wondering;  This means that Firmware updates for the flight controller are first sent from the phone or other computer via IP over WIFI to the Sonix board, then from there using MAVLINK via a serial port to the flight controller with the last hop being special messages to the controller via DSM."
102,Regarding drone transmission power,3,"Hi, Could anybody please tell if a drone transmits more power or its controller? Regards, Avigyan.","That is correct * thanks for adding to the discussion. Additionally, there are some parameters within the flight controller which can modify radio transmission TX and RX power.  You can play with those to get more distance from your SV. For the OP’s original question, the transmitter will have the highest power, and be transmitting the most data during normal flight conditions. The drone (i think) is only sending basic flight mode data back tot he controller for the SV2450. in the 2700, tridge expanded the DSM interface (required a new Tx board as well) to send back more data to the controller.  I’m not sure exactly what they both send, but you can look into the code to see for yourself The master branch is the 2450 the cc2500 branch is the Journey the beken branch is the Fury …I think…I might have that backwards. *"
103,"V2700 GPS Journey, think I made a mistake",1,"Hi everyone, sorry,but this is gonna be a long one. Sorry if I sound like a Newbie, because I am. So my wife bought this for me on December 7th, i had to exchange it for another on the 9th. Took me two days to figure out one of the tiny motor gears was missing a tooth or two right out of the box. It would fly very unstable. Second one is slightly more stable, and I mean very slight. It drifts around a lot and tends to suddenly go where ever it wants. It one seems to happen in a GPS lock. If I take off in the house before it gets a lock it flys great. Once it locks in fun is over. I know they are not meant for indoor, I am not comfortable with taking it outside again. Already had to chase it twice before I figured out pushing the power button disarms it and it just falls. I was looking at this one because I thought it would be good to learn on since it should not take off and fly away but I may have been wrong. All setting are at defaults. SV support is trying to help. Somethings they asked are if firmware needed update… (I am going to check that.) Type of mobile device… (Samsung Galaxy s9+) which is not on the apps supported device list. SD Card… (none yet. I only have 2 GB ones right now.). So guess what I want to know is,  Can GPS  lock be disabled and turned back on when I figure out what i am doing. Should I just take it back and stick to surface Vehicles as I was doing. Is there something in the profile settings I should change or tweak. Still going through a learning experience on these things.  Again sorry so long. I am just frustrated that i am on number 2 of these and it is either defective or maybe I went “too advanced” for my first one. I have searched everywhere online and in here with no luck on a fix. Checked gears, did motorcal and listened for any difference in sound. I just don’t know.","It doesn’t sound like anything is wrong with your Journey. You just do not want to try to fly in “GPS” mode indoors.  The location errors that all the RF reflections will create in that environment will cause exactly the erratic behavior you describe. If you really need to fly it indoors, then what you want to do is figure out how to put it in altitude hold mode for indoor use.  The V2400 had a button dedicated to this and I’ve only just realized that the button was assigned a different use on the V2700. I only have the older V2400 GPS, but I strongly suspect the ability to assign a button to switch between “GPS” (loiter) and “indoor” (altitude hold) is still present in the newer models.  You might try The web interface at * and choose the parameters page. Then assign altitude hold mode to one of the action buttons.  Don’t change anything else on the parameters page until you learn more and don’t try the web interface at all if you are not willing to learn a bit about ardupilot and how it is used on your new toy. You could also safely change flight modes manually using a ground station (google for what to install on your mobile device and how to configure it to talk to the skyviper. If you do decide to learn more about Ardupilot, you will be rewarded with new capabilities for your V2700. Can someone familiar with the V2700 buttons help Jason out with more details? –Brad"
103,"V2700 GPS Journey, think I made a mistake",2,"Hi everyone, sorry,but this is gonna be a long one. Sorry if I sound like a Newbie, because I am. So my wife bought this for me on December 7th, i had to exchange it for another on the 9th. Took me two days to figure out one of the tiny motor gears was missing a tooth or two right out of the box. It would fly very unstable. Second one is slightly more stable, and I mean very slight. It drifts around a lot and tends to suddenly go where ever it wants. It one seems to happen in a GPS lock. If I take off in the house before it gets a lock it flys great. Once it locks in fun is over. I know they are not meant for indoor, I am not comfortable with taking it outside again. Already had to chase it twice before I figured out pushing the power button disarms it and it just falls. I was looking at this one because I thought it would be good to learn on since it should not take off and fly away but I may have been wrong. All setting are at defaults. SV support is trying to help. Somethings they asked are if firmware needed update… (I am going to check that.) Type of mobile device… (Samsung Galaxy s9+) which is not on the apps supported device list. SD Card… (none yet. I only have 2 GB ones right now.). So guess what I want to know is,  Can GPS  lock be disabled and turned back on when I figure out what i am doing. Should I just take it back and stick to surface Vehicles as I was doing. Is there something in the profile settings I should change or tweak. Still going through a learning experience on these things.  Again sorry so long. I am just frustrated that i am on number 2 of these and it is either defective or maybe I went “too advanced” for my first one. I have searched everywhere online and in here with no luck on a fix.

So I was researching flight modes and what they do last night and actually got it to fly descend enough to handle. The first one I had would automatically go to Loiter mode when I took off… this one wasn’t.  I don’t remember what mode it was going to but it wasn’t loiter. I programmed some of the buttons to switch modes depending on what I was looking for. I think a bit more of educating myself on this it will be fine. Some more tweeking on it this weekend should do it. I did try to connect it to Mission Maker, which I guess replaces Tower app… but it didn’t seem to want to. Have to play with it."

104,How Do You Transport & Store Your SkyViper & Tx?,5,Pics and ideas please.,"OK.  Here is a nice cheap solution if you want to baby your SkyViper. This is a fairly sturdy covered shoe box which just happened to fit width and length perfectly.  I cut at the corners, folded and glued down down the sides of the box to make the height required. The formed plastic cradle which held the SkyViper in the original shipping box is taped to center of the bottom of the box and the foam pad glued to the cover holds the drone in place when the cover is closed.  This avoids putting stress on the arms which might deform the plastic over time. The extra cardboard barriers are held in place with flaps folded and taped to the bottom of the box.  These barriers create storage areas for the batteries and accessories and provide crush resistance while it is crammed in a backpack or suitcase. I have used this box in a carry-on when I want to bring some cheap fun along on a trip. The controller is less fragile, especially if the thumb levers are removed.  It gets tossed in the bag alongside the box."

I never owned one, but i read several places that it just didn’t live up to the capabilities that SkyRocket wanted it to.  And basically the reason they switched to Ardupilot was because they were pegging up against the capabilities of CleanFlight with the 2900 pro and they couldn’t get the CleanFlight development team to get on board making changes they needed. AP on the other hand jumped at the opportunity. I do wish they would have made the Journey a Brushless model though. : that’s disappointing."

110,2700 and auto mode button mapping,1,I am hoping someone here can help. I upgraded from a 2450 gps to the journey 2700. I am trying to map auto mode to the transmitter buttons like I have done with the 2450. The transmitter with the 2700 no longer has a mode button marked. I am trying to set a dual button press I have done with the 2450. Mode button plus bumper button at the same time sets auto mode. Which button on the 2700 transmitter now corresponds to the mode button?,"Hi Eric, The Journey uses Profiles, which is different from last year. With profiles, you can swap over to a different mode and stack of parameters with a button press on the NORMAL/SPORT button. There are technically 4 profiles, but only two get banked as active at any given time. For example, out of the box there are 2 profiles: NORMAL and SPORT. They are both essentially LOITER with different max angles to allow the flight to be faster in SPORT mode. There are other params that are different, but only to affect the ‘feel’ of the flight. I often setup Profile 1 to be essentially the “LOITER SPORT” mode, and make Profile 2 like a Sporty “ALT HOLD” mode if I want to fly without GPS. I know this doesn’t really help your 2 button combo request, but it may help you setup an easy way to quickly turn on the desired elements you want by creating a ‘custom’ profile."

111,Sky Viper Firmware with hardcoded baud rate needed,0,"Hi, I have researched this topic and have determined that my problem is due to changing the baud rate that doesn’t match with the Sonic board.

I’m a complete newbie in development and was trying to read up on the wiki but so far its gone way over my head. Can someone please provide some help on how to build a firmware or provide one ?

114,Photos: Adding 5.8G Analog FPV to Journey,1,"The Journey of course has its own Wi-Fi based FPV capabilities. But FPV over Wi-Fi has well known problems of lag and video breakup, even over short distances. I was curious to see if I could get 5.8G analog FPV going with the Journey so that a conventional set of FPV goggles could be used. The photos included show how I did it, using an inexpensive Eachine TX03 unified camera/transmitter/antenna. I 3D printed the little adjustable white plastic holder. The assembly is held onto the Journey using a type of self-adhering band (not typical Velcro hook and loop in this case). The antenna is tied with thread to the top protective support of the holder, to help avoid antenna damage in case of crashes (apparently if that TX03 antenna breaks off, repairing it is a royal pain due to the design of the PC board). I’ll note here that the Journey is extremely sturdy. Through some crashes and even stalled props, there has been no discernible damage whatsoever and I’m still on the first set of props. I could have used a separate small battery for the new assembly, but opted instead to add an appropriate connector to the included battery (and my other batteries that I’m using with the Journey). The position of the camera means that you do have the props in the field of view, but in practice this isn’t a problem. Liftoff with the extra weight is no problem at all, and in fact the Journey actually seemed to be even more stable than usual with the extra weight. I have not yet determined the extent to which the added weight and additional power drain from the TX03 are affecting the flight time. This turns out to work very well, much better than I had anticipated. Any questions, please let me know! *   *   *   *   *   *","Hello, good to see your piggyback rig.

115,Mods for night flight?,3,I have a Sky Viper Scout (v2450HD) still using the original software for now. I would like to hook up some Schwinn bicycle lights (LED) for night flights if possible.  Does anyone have ideas or suggestions on how to go about it or just don’t do it?,The stock LEDs waste most of their light by pointing inside the mostly black cavity. A modification which which adds no weight but increases night visibility greatly is to carefully drill a hole in the plastic lens the same size (3mm if I remember correctly) as the LED and assemble with the LED partially through the hole with the lens pointed down.  Position the hole as close as you can to the center of the drone so the leads will be long enough to allow the LED to reach after they are bent at a 90 degree angle.  This can be done without disassembling more than the lens.

C2 graph line stays at top where other motors throttle are busy to adjust. This shows , means C2 motor is not giving enough power even at full. Cause is the Motor may be worn or gear is not turning smooth etc. If the motor cannot give enough power to keep attitude, copter will land there. *"

I check for the devices connected to the network, but i dont see the skyviper or other unknown device.

Sounds like your  viper is not even connecting to your network. Only thing I can think of is an issue with the text formatting of WIFI.TXT, and/or your router somehow rejecting the connection. One thing to try, when you edit WIFI.TXT, say notepad++, is to check end of line settings/conversion if editing on windows. Shouldn’t make a difference, but some strange settings could make the password or file invalid. Also is your router set to accept 192.168.X.Y addresses? I think you wrote earlier that you had tried to set its address to 192.99.1.2 and it still didn’t work so this should be the case. Can you see if you can set your router to see what it rejects and see that it at least sees the MAC address of the viper? Maybe one thing to try, sort of desperate: Grab the MAC  address of the viper when in client mode and write it down, and set the router DHCP to assign a “known to work IP address” to that MAC address and try accessing with browser."

Have you tried another router? I suspect something is wrong with DHCP  settings on yours. Normally if you have WIFI.TXT on your SD card (no need to change Sonix source), and configure your router for DHCP address reservation (e.g. 192.168.1.101 associated with MAC address of Viper, with you router being, say, 192.168.1.1), then * will get you to the web screen within at most one minute (more like 20 seconds or less on the ones I have) after power up of the viper.  And mission planner or qgc will “see” the viper  after connecting. You should also see with wireshark or equivalent the router binding ip address to MAC address, then UDP  broadcast packets on port 14550 from Viper. I’d try with another router, you can get cheap Wireless N used ones for $25 … Should work with stock settings after configuring for Internet connection, besides the DHCP reservation bit."

127,Skyviper V2450gps and Image Recognition,3,"Hi there, Ken here. I’m a Multi-noob. Noob to Linux, Noob to Python, Noob to Drones, Noob to ArduPilot, and Noob to other stuff I don’t even know I need to know yet!!!..but I am patient and persistent and will do what I have to to do what I want. I do have a background with Windows applicaiton software development and I started my career as an electronics technician. I am extremely appreciative that SkyRocket Toys provided the SkyViper platform so I could explore the ArduPilot project…thank you. I also would like to express my sincere admiration and appreciation to all the individuals that contribute their time and efforts developing the ArduPilot project. My thanks to all!!! I can’t believe this is free!!! Absolutely AWESOME. After trying to fly manually (which I suck at 'cause I can’t see well) I found the Mission Planner program. I was able to create missions and send the SV around my property…however it lacked accuracy using just GPS coordinates. I am trying to accurately position my SkyViper V2450GPS at various way points. Using Mission Planner and GPS coordinates gets me close, but not exact. I thought I would try using a companion computer and image recognition to locate and hover over a marker…like an ‘X’ pattern. My plan is to use the Mission GPS data to get close to a waypoint and then kick in the image recognition to accurately position the drone over the ‘X’. My initial questions are broad and have to do with the preferred way to get the image/video from the Skyviper and send commands to accurately position the drone over the ‘X’ pattern. I did a lot of reading on how it can be done but nothing specific for the STM32 or Sonix board. I mainly found posts on how to interface with a Pixhawk flight controller and companion computer. I did a lot of thinking about how to make that work with a SkyViper but I still don’t have enough knowledge to know what can and can’t be done with the SkyViper hardware to get it to work. I plan on using a RaspberryPI3 as a companion computer. I would appreciate any assistance to get me going on the right track… For instance, to get images from the SkyViper Do I enable a com port on the Sonix board and hardwire a serial connection between it and a companion computer? The Sonix Board provides a web interface…do I use MavLink commands and send them to its UDP port 14550 to get images? Do I use OpenCV? Do I use APSync? Do I use APWeb? Generic SkyViperV2450GPS interface questions What does Pixhawk compatible mean? Is there an API that I can use with the SkyViper to ‘interface’ with it’s hardware? Thank you for any assistance. Best regards, Ken","So, to get the photos off the Sonix, you could use this * The Ardupilot (and APSync etc) don’t transmit the photos (AFAIK).  But the Sonix board with APWeb does. And this document in the link does show how you can get the live video into an off-board computer. However, I think you’re going to find that you’re not going to have very good performance.  First off, you’re limited to the FPS of the onboard camera (live feed is only 15FPS) and then you’re going to be limited by the storage time + transfer rate of the video to your CC. Then your CC needs to process the video, determine a X/Y/Z error, then translate that into roll/pitch/yaw commands for the copter all at about probably close to 50hz or more to have stable performance… I just don’t think that is going to happen. Even if you had a supercomputer doing the video processing, the FPS of the camera is 15FPS, and that’s it.  It only hits 30FPS when storing to the SD card, and even that can sometimes be spotty. Oh, and then there is the image resolution and the “jello” anyways, that doc above would get you started. Just didn’t want to drop a link on you without providing some technical gotchas that you’re going to face. good luck!"

129,Sky Viper 2.0 app questions,0,Does anyone know of a tutorial or manual for this app?,
130,"Some hints regarding Journey ArduCopter ""Simple"" mode",0,"I just ran some tests of ArduCopter “simple” mode on the Journey, thought I’d pass them along to save others some time. First, at least in the default “toy” mode (I haven’t tested with toy mode disabled) it appears that the usual “SIMPLE” bitmask for specifying flight modes that have simple enabled is ignored. That is, even with the bits set for various flight modes, the quad appears to always initialize with simple mode disabled for all flight modes. On the other hand, the SV flight parameters include a “simple mode toggle” selection that can be assigned to a transmitter button or mode+button combo. This does work to enable and disable simple mode (either before flying or on the fly), though of course you need to keep track of which mode you’re in since it is a toggle. Again, I don’t know if the normal bitmask would work with toy mode disabled. Any questions, please let me know. Thanks.",
131,Comprehensive Documentation?,1,"I’ve been demonstrating the Journey, and observers are extremely impressed – the potentials for this “toy” are really quite extraordinary. One question that kept coming up – that I couldn’t adequately answer – is the lack of comprehensive documentation – not so much for the hardware (the design is already pretty wonderful, note the lack of significant interference between magnetometer, GPS [I routinely lock on 16 sats indoors!], and FPV) – but in terms of user instructions for flight and the SV app. An incredible amount of sophistication is present in this system, but it isn’t practical (for example) to point most people at the ArduCopter docs. I immediately received questions about the app UI. It tends to assume a level of knowledge that many users will not have at hand. For example, the presumed battery indicator seems to always show 100% in my testing so far (as opposed to showing a battery voltage). When asked what that indicator really represents, I don’t have a ready answer. There is what appears to be a “distance from home” indicator, but its values do not necessarily lead clearly to user understanding of what its actual representation of “home” is – sometimes it seems to show decreasing values as you move away from the assumed home position (from power on? arming?). Selecting the “follow me” mode immediately asks the user to arm the flyer – but the existing documentation doesn’t explicitly explain what “arming” means in this context (though we know what it means of course in the typical ArduCopter context). If the user momentarily raises the throttle from the center position (and quickly allows it to return to the center), the flyer goes into the presumed armed state with props spinning, but their speed gradually increases and if not quickly throttled up to launch or powered down will become unstable and potentially flop over on the ground. Let me be clear that I do not view these sorts of issues as defects in the physical system, but rather of note because there does not currently exist (AFAIK!) comprehensive documentation that explains these issues, suitable lets say for a sophisticated amateur. So, do we know of any more comprehensive documentation around that I’ve missed? I’ve done a pretty good search around the Net and on the support site of course. I don’t really relish the idea of having to write up this kind of documentation myself, but if I really have to I can – I’ve done this sort of writing plenty of times over my career. Thanks all.","So, you’re right, for the most part the documentation for how the “Journey” works is not comprehensive…though the “advertised features” are probably explained at the bare minimum to make it so you can use it. That said, it should (emphasis on should) be good enough for a consumer to understand the “toy features” of the craft.  Also, some of the messages you see in the App are probably just MAVlink alerts being displayed directly, so the App would have to translate that to amateur language. But, you’re going to have two different types of Journey buyers. * Typical: Wants a toy for his kid. Figures, if the kid can figure out a Smartphone, he/she can figure out how this app works. And besides, people don’t read manuals anyways. #2 Enthusiast looking for a cheap AP drone: Already knows where to find the AP documentation, and typically, already knows all the AP lingo. There is a potential #3 buyer. #3 Typical, but COULD be an enthusiasts convert if he/she finds AP to be awesome.  This person looks at the box and the big fold out instruction sheet and says “Hey what is this ArduPilot thang” and googles it and then becomes interested in reading the documentation. All of your comments are valid, but for a $100 toy, you can’t really expect a 5 page manual telling you about all the features of the App, Drone, etc"

I’m optimistic it’s the same “debug console” mentioned by Andrew Tridgell in his “Flight Board Hacking” message. I’ve purchased a Black Magic Probe in hopes the SkyViper supports SWD (Serial Wire Debug) on its “debug console” port. UPDATE: The microcontroller in the SkyViper is STM32F427VIT6 in LQFP100 package. For single stepping with gdb the relevant pins on the STM32F427VIT6 (LQFP 100-pin) are 72-PA13 (SWDIO) and 76-PA14 (SWCLK). Pins 72-PA13 (SWDIO) and 76-PA14 (SWCLK) overlay JTAG Pins (JTMS) and (JTCK) respectively. I had no idea. Yet another of Andrew Tridgell’s very helpful videos showed him connecting directly to the microcontroller pins for JTAG debug.

137,Bricked Sky Viper Transmitter,1,"Hello. I have just started using a Sky Viper Scout yesterday and that same day, the transmitter malfunctioned. It would connect to the drone perfectly fine but, when I gave any input, the drone wouldn’t respond. I even checked the motors through the calibration menu and, they were working as usual. I then decided to upgrade the firmware of the transmitter through the web interface and when it was “completed”,  it had bricked the transmitter. When I turn the controller on, it just shows a green light on top of the “normal mode” button and there are no tones or sounds. Pressing any button on the transmitter doesn’t change a thing. I can’t even turn the transmitter off with the power button ( I need to manually remove the batteries). I checked the status of the controller on the web interface and, it’s status was “off”. I have already tried to power it on while holding the video button and holding the left joystick in the down position to check if I can unbrick the transmitter with this solution, * but, it didn’t power on as it should.

Which requires the motors to provide more thrust, which may be difficult if battery is low, since batteries may not have a perfectly level power curve…they tend to drop off towards the low end, which means you won’t have 100% thrust from all motors, and therefore compensating for turbulence will be more sluggish/unresponsive. Just the low battery in general might do that, for lack of full thrust to compensate for breeze or whatever else causes you a slight wobble.

Can you bind 2 factory transmitters to 1 SkyViper, with the possibility of handing-off mid-flight? ","Q1: What the craft does when you breach the fence is completely programmable. I think the SV will just keep on for X # of yards. The transmitter will do tones to let you know you’ve breach the fence. I think there is a “second layer” that will eventually RTL.  But because my transmitter reception has been so poor, I’ve never gotten that far. Q2: No idea, you’d have to post your mission commands. Q3: TAKEOFF and LAND are not necessary. FYI, when the craft gets to the “last” waypoint. It’ll transition to Loiter in place.  So if you don’t have it coming home, then it’ll just stay there.  I almost always put an RTL command at the end of all missions. And if I decide I don’t want it to RTL, I just override it.  TAKEOFF is sticky, because Auto is not “armable” which means your SV won’t go into Auto mode until you arm it.  Because the controller doesn’t have an “Arm” button (or switch or whatever) you cannot get it into “Arm” mode in order to then transition into Auto.  The way the SV works is when you push the takeoff button, it arms and runs a “script” to perform a takeoff.  If you have a GCS (like MP or Tower) up when running the show, then you can push the “Arm” button on the GCS.  Then, you can transition to Auto, and if you have a takeoff command it’ll do that.  … Not sure what it’ll do if you don’t have a takeoff command lol."

","Joe, you could use  SRTM terrain data , but it would be far from precise compared to using the baro. Likewise  using GPS only wouldn’t work well,   GPS  altitude precision is not very good. A rangefinder would get you absolute distance from ground but hard to think of how integration could be done on a SkyViper, both from a weight and connection perspective. Not sure what you are trying to do, but note that you can use negative altitudes on an auto mission. So unless you need precise terrain following (for which a rangefinder would be needed) I can’t really think of a situation where navigating with relative altitude (from take-off point) would be an issue."

Is this related to *’s * which specifies the parameters to change? My goal is to fly two or more SVs on Auto waypoints in Tower using the SV Tx, outdoors. If Launched from different positions and then switched to Auto at the same time via the Tx mode buttons, theoretically each SV would reach a given waypoints in sequence, not simultaneously, right?

Many thanks for that documentation. Now I come to my issue: I cannot change configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY from 0 to 1 in the FreeRTOSConfig.h file.

If you have bright lighting (especially when pointing towards the sun) or low lighting, you’ll get more jello.

142,Skyviper 2018 model video review,9,*,"It’s a new sensor, but there are still the limitations to deal with at this price-point. Jello is still present in the brightest of scenarios, as the sensor lets in the most light the shutter is running the fastest. Lesser light helps the scenario, actually, and we’ve seen some good results with indoor video as well as dusk/dawn/overcast scenarios. I’ll see if I can find a test vid I did here int he office the other day. Just gotta make sure there isn’t any unreleased products visible in the video and then I’ll post it if it’s OK."

Something that might help Ardupilot become the RTF or BNF of choice might be to shore up that toy_mode code. Tridge looks to have done a pretty good job of making it “Generic code” that could be used in many instances, but it still has a pretty SV flavor.  But, if this code was made to be more universal and easier to be integrated into any “toy” or “adult toy,” and AP had a “dedicated” product integration team, that would help get AP in a lot more hands.  I say “dedicated” because it would only be a group that, when AP gets a request from a company to help them create a product they break off and to the integration and then come back. Anyways, just rattling off thoughts. I know on another thread there was a lot of talk about “who are we trying to attract”  and as a small time supporter, but mostly just outside observationist, my opinion doesn’t really matte rmuch"
142,Skyviper 2018 model video review,19,*, * in the video mentions some (other products) that they are hoping for next year. I’m hoping they’ll finally re-release the 2900 so we get a SV with AP and Brushless motors

142,Skyviper 2018 model video review,21,*,"Hi there! Sorry for the delay… things are busy here since the product has been hitting the shelves. I would personally love nothing more than to bring the 2900 back and make it fly like we had originally intended! That frame is 2 years old, and at the time we were putting it together we were constantly being told “It’ll never fly!” “You can’t have motors that small!!” Etc. Etc. Etc. I feel it was 1 year too soon for that frame. Going with CleanFlight and trying to work a reliable GPS performance into it was mind-numbing. iNav had just started their branch from Cleanflight for the same issues. In Manual mode, that thing is a BLAST to fly! We still fly modded 2900s around the office all the time. Unfortunately, Retail partners didn’t like the price point so it was a tough sell. Ultimately, though, we learned a LOT (you learn more from failures than from wins) and the GPS functionality that was lacking is what ended up getting us to develop with *! Sacrifices, but victories in the end."
142,Skyviper 2018 model video review,22,*,"I would imagine, especially with the high end DJI drones on one side and then a bunch of other “stuff” on the other side these days, it is a hard sell to put a $250 drone on the shelves in-between with no gimbal or HD camera and try to differentiate yourself.  Marketing is tough (also was one of my favorite classes with my MBA), especially when you’re trying to differentiate amongst a crowd of inferior products, at a similar price-point, when the target customer isn’t informed enough to know (or care?) the difference."

I check this site about every other week to see if there are any changes. *  Tridge has been a lot quieter than I saw when the 2450GPS was being talked up in the dev calls back in october.

Also, it’s a good idea to adjust the parameters since they weren’t setup for stunts. You can do all this on the APWeb Flight parameters page. If you don’t change the parameters then you need to ensure you have at LEAST 100 ft before pressing the buttons.  The default values are not very fast. I recommend changing these before attempting. But it does work. Conversly, if you get even better, you can start to play with the ACRO parameters and can actually fly as flip. That’s a lot more fun!..and nerve racking lol. Here are some parameters to change. flip params FLIP_RAMP_CD    500 FLIP_RAMP_MS    350 FLIP_ROT_RATE   3000 FLIP_ACCEL_MAX  3000 Here are the explanations for each parameter *  Always, be ready to press the power button to cut the motors off in case of a crash, to save your motors.

I also modified my antenna to vertical as below. Initial test looks good, kept good WIFI connection for data (not for video) during 500m distance round trip. Simple mod, simply glued antenna there.   WIFI distance varies a lot with phone/tablet make. Nexus 7 2013 tablet gave this result, far better than my phone. Distance varies on each SV, too. One of mine was able to to keep MavLink connection up to 1.1km, but only to one direction, because antenna was held horizontally in arm. I am hoping this gives equal distance at any direction.

SV antenna sits horizontally and I am experiencing it tends to lose connection when it makes 180 deg turn, I suspect it is due to antenna directionality. These dipole antenna signal reception is weakest when it points toward tx. I fly at grass field and it will interfere if placed downward. SV will be a few 100 meter away when connection is critical, upward and downward does not matter much. So far no GPS issue as posted log graph shows. *, very quick! I guess max range will not change, but connection should be more stable at any SV direction, *, curious to see the result of Tx antenna mod!  (sorry edited)."

Since the copper core of coax can be withdrawn and re-inserted in the center nylon core, why not just:  Cut an oversized length of ready made cable (I had some old stiff RG6) remove the copper core wind the center 70mm into a coil now you can accurately trim one end to 60mm trim down the jacket and shielding leaving the fitting undisturbed to accommodate sleeve balun . . . and I didn’t have any copper tubing on hand so a balun doesn’t show in the pics but easily added after removing copper core . . . a second time slide 25mm of copper tubing (sleeve balun) over the entire housing and solder the shield to it reinsert copper core and trim leaving .25"" exposed inside fitting . . . am I missing something or would this be a lot easier and more precise?

The GPS, might need to be mounted special, as the 2900’s case may not allow sufficient pass-through of the signal…all about experimentation and whether you’re willing to lose both a 2450 and a 2900 lol BUT, you COULD gain an AMAZING brushless 2450 GPS!"

146,V2450GPS Fly Away,1,"I had set a region of interest on my house and a circle waypoint around it and noticed it had trouble maintaining altitude and it was barely above the trees when it returned to the back yard for the last waypoint.  It also had a little more trouble staying on the circle than my home build with pixhawk ever does.  I should have stopped then and checked the log, but the low cost and lack of sweat equity made me too brave.  I changed battery and before the controller registered a solid GPS fix, but after tower said I had 12 sats and 3d fix I foolishly launched it from my hand and put it above the trees, thinking it would lock in faster with a better view of the sky.  I actively corrected it’s drift for a few seconds and it was still wandering a little when I looked down to check and saw that the controller light was now solid green.  Thinking it was good to go, I looked back up and couldn’t locate the drone.  This thing is much harder to see than my home built frame.  A very short while later, Tower and the receiver both reported loss of connection. I could still hear it for a short time but by the time I walked past the trees bordering my back yard, in the direction it had last been drifting, I couldn’t see or hear it anymore.  I walked around my neighbors yards and eventually found a small area on a low rise next to a large wild area with small trees and lots of weedy brush where the transmitter reported telemetry was restored and that GPS lock was still established.  I couldn’t see it in the sky or hear it or find it on nearby lawns or rooftops, so I assume it had landed in the weeds.  My phone couldn’t see the wifi signal so even though the drone thought it knew where it was, it did me no good.  I walked around the area hoping to recover the wifi signal, but the weeds and mud are nasty and I had no success before controller eventually stopped seeing anything back from the drone so I assume the battery cut out. What went wrong and other questions: I admit the home location which got set was probably less accurate than normal, but I wouldn’t think it was too far off since I had a 3D fix for several seconds before I launched.  I don’t know if Tower updated home on the display when it reported home had been set.  Does Tower grab the home location automatically or do I have to download the waypoints to update it and i was seeing home from the previous flight? On a few earlier flights I had noticed it fly in circles in loiter mode.  A few days ago, I did run through tower’s compass calibration procedure, thinking that was an issue.  I’m not sure if that helped much.   Does Ardupilot adjust compass calibration on each flight on the SV? I didn’t change any other parameters except maximum transmit power (Does this do anything?) so it should have tried to return home at a safe altitude when the receiver lost signal.  Also, what is the default geo-fence distance?  That might give me some hints on where to search in the weeds. I do own a self-powered FM beacon which I always fly on my larger, more expensive quad, but I’ve never had to to break out the phase-sensitive active antenna to find a lost drone and the SV is so light it seemed a shame to add any more weight to it.    I’ll order another SV and perhaps next time I’ll see how it flys with an extra several grams under the battery. It will be dark by the time I get home today, but I may search a bit more tomorrow morning, though I doubt I will find it.  Given the occasional circles, my best guess at what went wrong was that the compass calibration was still bad or the compass was misbehaving for some other reason. Short of finding the little thing and looking at the log, any ideas on what went wrong? Thanks","A small update after searching in vain this morning.  Turns out I didn’t have the micro SD installed on the last day after all.  I found it in my SD reader this morning when I went to review some search video I shot from the big bird this morning.  So, no hope of getting the logs from this flight, but I have the logs from earlier flights.  I will check them for any signs of trouble from earlier flights. I do have a crazy feature idea.  I don’t know how often developers or sophisticated customers might able to get close enough to a lost SV to get telemetry from the transmitter, but not close enough for wifi.  But, I suppose it might be possible to add a feature to send last known GPS coordinates back on the DSM link and read it by counting LED flashes after activating a special button sequence on the transmitter.  Only the low order digits would need to be sent.  I can’t see this being useful for most consumers, but I would have found it very handy on Sunday."

Thanks","Hi Brad, It would have set home at the location the GPS lock got good enough for the EKF to be happy, not at the point it got a 3D fix. That is the normal ArduCopter behaviour, but for situations where the pilot takes off before full GPS lock it isn’t ideal. Czar is working on a change that would monitor the GPS horizontal position accuracy and if it is reasonable at arming then it would use the 3D fix at that point instead of using an in-flight fix. A new version of the SkyViper app would also have fixed this by allowing you to set home to the position from your phone (called “return to device” or RTD). Unfortunately without either of those two things the home would have been set to the in-flight location, which clearly wasn’t ideal for you. Sorry you lost it! Cheers, Tridge"

Based on what you said, I believe it would have been set while I still had it in sight. The transmitter was indicating solid green when I looked down (Just before I lost sight of the drone) and I believe I also heard Tower report that the home location had been set just before I looked down and lost sight of it.  I think the fact it was flying at about 50 meters and is so small contributed to my not being able to spot it again when I looked back up.  I could still hear it for a few seconds even though I couldn’t see it.  So I believe something else went wrong in addition to my foolishly taking off before I got the solid green light.  It apparently had good EKF while it was still near me and should have set the home location near to the last place I saw it.  It just drifted off for some reason even though it was in position hold mode with solid green light and it didn’t get back home when the receiver lost the signal.  There was a some wind, but not more than the SV has coped with in the past.  The battery was full to start and I’d say it was out of hearing range less than a minute into the flight. The loss itself is not a big deal.  The low risk of injury and the low cost of replacement is what is great about experimenting with this thing. Sorry I don’t have logs from that particular flight for you. –Brad"

I walked around my neighbors yards and eventually found a small area on a low rise next to a large wild area with small trees and lots of weedy brush where the transmitter reported telemetry was restored and that GPS lock was still established.  I couldn’t see it in the sky or hear it or find it on nearby lawns or rooftops, so I assume it had landed in the weeds.  My phone couldn’t see the wifi signal so even though the drone thought it knew where it was, it did me no good.  I walked around the area hoping to recover the wifi signal, but the weeds and mud are nasty and I had no success before controller eventually stopped seeing anything back from the drone so I assume the battery cut out. What went wrong and other questions: I admit the home location which got set was probably less accurate than normal, but I wouldn’t think it was too far off since I had a 3D fix for several seconds before I launched.  I don’t know if Tower updated home on the display when it reported home had been set.  Does Tower grab the home location automatically or do I have to download the waypoints to update it and i was seeing home from the previous flight? On a few earlier flights I had noticed it fly in circles in loiter mode.  A few days ago, I did run through tower’s compass calibration procedure, thinking that was an issue.  I’m not sure if that helped much.   Does Ardupilot adjust compass calibration on each flight on the SV? I didn’t change any other parameters except maximum transmit power (Does this do anything?) so it should have tried to return home at a safe altitude when the receiver lost signal.  Also, what is the default geo-fence distance?  That might give me some hints on where to search in the weeds. I do own a self-powered FM beacon which I always fly on my larger, more expensive quad, but I’ve never had to to break out the phase-sensitive active antenna to find a lost drone and the SV is so light it seemed a shame to add any more weight to it.    I’ll order another SV and perhaps next time I’ll see how it flys with an extra several grams under the battery. It will be dark by the time I get home today, but I may search a bit more tomorrow morning, though I doubt I will find it.

Yes, I put tlogs up on dropbox and emailed you a link.  I hope direct contact for that purpose is OK.  The privacy sensitive part of me didn’t really want the world to have everything in those logs.  The last one seems to be the flyaway.  I took a quick look at it and do see some indications of unhealthy EKF.  The wifi connection seemed to drop before the GPS lock was good enough, but I’m still pretty sure I saw solid green on the transmitter after I lost sight of it and I definitely saw solid green several minutes later when I was wandering around trying to get close enough to the lost bird for a wifi signal. I also did some cautious experimenting this morning with a different SV.  It looks like taking off in “GPS” mode after tower is reporting a 3d fix, but before the fix is good enough for the green transmitter LED to stop blinking results in the flight mode changing from loiter to altitude hold immediately after arming.  The way it is reported  in the tlog made me think the transmitter made this change which seems bad.  I think the green LED still blinks in this mode which is very confusing.  Do the LEDs indicate the mode being requested by the transmitter or do they represent a mode received via telemetry?  In my tests this morning, the flight mode switched back to loiter (and home was updated a second time) after the GPS lock met the requirements. Once home is known, (It does seem to be set on takeoff even if the GPS fix is not firm), shouldn’t the drone attempt to return home when the transmitter signal is lost? Assuming you have time to look at the tlog, any comments on what it shows? Thanks!"

Thanks","Hi Brad, Presuming that log_udp_2017_11_19_15_11_59_783.tlog is the right log, it shows that the SkyViper auto-switched to ALT_HOLD mode on takeoff as the GPS lock was not good enough for LOITER. At the time the GPS was reporting a horizontal accuracy of 91 meters, and a vertical accuracy of 111 meters. The log only shows 30 seconds of ALT_HOLD flight before it stops. During that time the GPS accuracy didn’t improve (in fact it got worse). So at no point in the log did the flight board get a good enough GPS lock to set a home location. I can’t tell what happened after the log stops, but it looks like it was having a really hard time getting a good GPS lock. I don’t know why the GPS lock was so bad - maybe it was reflections off trees, or local RF interference, but with a lock this bad it really can’t do GPS navigation. Cheers, Tridge"

Thanks","I had a solid green GPS lite upon launch but noticed 2450 wanted to continue to bank in different directions without stick input.   Switching to alt-hold the viper flew perfectly.  Prior days the GPS would be solid and it flew great.   Recycled the bird to see if it was a hiccup and the problem persisted.   It would respond to stick inputs but there was a 3-5 second delay when it was acting up.    Chalking it off to a bad environment.  wish I could find an extra battery.

Thinking it was good to go, I looked back up and couldn’t locate the drone.  This thing is much harder to see than my home built frame.  A very short while later, Tower and the receiver both reported loss of connection. I could still hear it for a short time but by the time I walked past the trees bordering my back yard, in the direction it had last been drifting, I couldn’t see or hear it anymore.  I walked around my neighbors yards and eventually found a small area on a low rise next to a large wild area with small trees and lots of weedy brush where the transmitter reported telemetry was restored and that GPS lock was still established.  I couldn’t see it in the sky or hear it or find it on nearby lawns or rooftops, so I assume it had landed in the weeds.  My phone couldn’t see the wifi signal so even though the drone thought it knew where it was, it did me no good.  I walked around the area hoping to recover the wifi signal, but the weeds and mud are nasty and I had no success before controller eventually stopped seeing anything back from the drone so I assume the battery cut out. What went wrong and other questions: I admit the home location which got set was probably less accurate than normal, but I wouldn’t think it was too far off since I had a 3D fix for several seconds before I launched.  I don’t know if Tower updated home on the display when it reported home had been set.  Does Tower grab the home location automatically or do I have to download the waypoints to update it and i was seeing home from the previous flight? On a few earlier flights I had noticed it fly in circles in loiter mode.  A few days ago, I did run through tower’s compass calibration procedure, thinking that was an issue.  I’m not sure if that helped much.   Does Ardupilot adjust compass calibration on each flight on the SV? I didn’t change any other parameters except maximum transmit power (Does this do anything?) so it should have tried to return home at a safe altitude when the receiver lost signal.  Also, what is the default geo-fence distance?  That might give me some hints on where to search in the weeds. I do own a self-powered FM beacon which I always fly on my larger, more expensive quad, but I’ve never had to to break out the phase-sensitive active antenna to find a lost drone and the SV is so light it seemed a shame to add any more weight to it.    I’ll order another SV and perhaps next time I’ll see how it flys with an extra several grams under the battery. It will be dark by the time I get home today, but I may search a bit more tomorrow morning, though I doubt I will find it.  Given the occasional circles, my best guess at what went wrong was that the compass calibration was still bad or the compass was misbehaving for some other reason.

And maybe they’ll create a Pro App too, that more complements the features of AP #5 while the 2450GPS has been incredibly well liked, received, and praised (Toy of the year nomination) it also probably hasn’t made Skyrocket a lot of money.

Certainly, not in a house with a wife and decorator like mine.  Maybe with a nano with blade guards but what’s the point?  Certainly not hi-res photography.  Even in the barn, there are too many things in the way of enjoyable flights.  Now that I have worked out the intricacies of geo-fence and and RTL, I am able to fly confidently on my 10 acres.  Auto take off and land is not the same as RTL which is return to launch, a GPS function.  A nice addition to the video capability would be some form of image stabilization along with 1080P. I’m not sure about the issues with GPS.  My experience has been that GPS is much less of a problem than the accelerometers.  I have often had to recalibrate the accelerometers to fix drift problems.  GPS stability has been great. Using Pos_hold, the Sky-Viper will hold it’s position ind winds strong enough to blow my hat off.  It will pitch over very dramatically into the wind and stay in place. It will twitch a little to counter the gusts but as long as the battery last, she will stay put. I have a strong faith in the reliability of GPS going back almost 20 years. Early GPS had some accuracy issues, but with the advent of Differential GPS and more satellites, I installed it on my sailboat and used it to navigate from the Chesapeake Bay to and throughout The Bahamas for 10 years.  The longest fully autonomous passage that I made was 98 nautical miles, from West Palm Beach in Florida to Great Sale Cay in the Abacos, crossing the Gulf Stream and entering the Bahama Banks relying totally on the Autopilot as I just sat and watched, hands off for about 20 hours.

Even though it’s not GPS, optical flow sensors make it super stable. Still images are great, and video is decent except for some frame skipping b/c of no onboard microSD -you can only record video on your phone. Still much better video quality than the v2450. But because it’s not GPS, max altitude is limited to 10m by default and 30m with a third party app. So, I’ve started using my Tello for videos and stills (and programming via DroneBlocks), but still using the trusty v2450 GPS when I want good height and range. It appears the new SV lineup includes optical flow sensors, so it’ll be interesting to see if that helps with stability on their new stunt drone (Fury) and streaming drone (Scout)."

148,Sky viper.....camera tracking mod?,1,"hello hope all is going well. i was looking to purchase the sky viper for software modding and wanted to know the community take on it. Most specifically I am looking to do some image tracking and live precision landing based off certain targets. My 2 questions are is the sky viper chipset open to custom code…i know it runs ardupilot but i am concerned with the access of it. My second question is if it is open to software modding, do you guys think the processor can handle live image processing? Please let me know. any help would be appreciated.","The Skyviper can run ArduCopter Master. The skyviper changes were merged into master back in february. Additionally, the Sonix board (companion computer with web server, video, wifi, etc), Ardupilot (factory version), and Transmitter code is all open source here * You can download the OEM firmware here * And the arducopter master (and betas) here * I’m not sure how much “space” is left on the Sonix.  It’s probably pretty tight, and most certainly doesn’t have the processing ability to do camera tracking…but I could be wrong.  The new 2018 models will have OpticalFlow built in, which is “technically” camera tracking  All the info you need to build and load the code is here *"

150,BATT2_ and TMODE Parameters Skyviper GPS defaults,1,"Why are these default settings used with the SV-GPS?

It just seems like these two settings are reversed according to the description used by ARDUCOPTER. I’m confused ","A few things. First, toy_mode.cpp has specific provisions in it to allow it to automatically switch to Loiter mode once GPS is good.  However, becauswe it is a toy, they (probably) didn’t want to force the user to wait for GPS. So it will start-up in Loiter mode, but the GPS light flashes. Once you get GPS, it’ll set the home positon (at that spot) and switch to Loiter.  I think I understand why they did this (to make it simple for users) but i’ve had to answer dozens of “complaints” about fly-aways in Loiter, when it reality, they weren’t really in Loiter mode.  Anyways, in general you don’t want your “first mode” to be a GPS required mode, but toy_mode compensates. Probably the comment within APWeb just needs to be changed.  Likely, SV could have saved a few fly-aways by preventing the user from taking off in Loiter mode selection when GPS wasn’t ready. The BATT1/2_Capacity parameters aren’t used. There is another parameter BATT_MONITOR that determines what readings it uses for the battery monitoring. It is set to Voltage only. So the SV only watches the pins for voltage levels.

(I can’t remember the default as I changed the behavior) But the interesting parameter is * With this parameter you can prevent the alarm from triggering during periods of high motor output. If you watch the battery level on the App, you’ll see the battery level drop dramatically when you throttle up. However,with this timer, it’ll prevent the alarm from triggering until it has been below the alarm value for more than X seconds. I set this up to be my critical alarm instead of my low alarm, by setting the crit value just above the absolute cut off value and low alarm to the value I tested for when I HAD to come home.  Then, I also set my BATT_Low action to “NONE” because I got tired of RTL flying me into trees when it triggered.  But the SV transmitter and SV toy_mode.cpp sets the lights to flash and Tx to beep. So that’s my “alarm” instead of auto RTL. Hopefully all that made sense. Basically, I use the “Low” alarm and not the Crit alarm for the specific reason that I wanted to take advantage of the BATT_Low_Timer parameter tokeep it from triggering the battery failsafe when using high throttle."

The Sonix is the WiFi board so it makes sense since the WebApp can’t seem to communicate to the Flight board. I bet if you went to the “Messages” tab on APWeb syste status page it’d have some messages like that. Oops, didn’t read *’s entire post, he already said that…still that sounds more logical. And I provided pictures  Easy to disassemble. Take off the battery holder with screws. A few more screws and the bottom casing comes off. You shouldn’t have to mess with anything else, as the Sonix will be right there. Just make sure the cable is snug and plug the battery back in…see if it starts working.  If the Tx is connecting AND your Wifi is connecting, then it is safe to assume both boards are working correctly…they just aren’t working together."

Once you diagnose your physical board connections, try telnet again, or maybe the baud is fine and it was just the board being disconnected and you’re hopefully good to go. Fingers crossed for you, dude."

You should literally be able to type “help” to list out all commands (I tested it myself before posting that, just to verify that it was “help” and not “?” or something else…it’s definitely “help”). For telnet, I am using JuiceSSH from my Android phone. PuTTY should work fine, tho; I’ve used it in the past for other purposes without issue, but not for anything drone related (simply out of circumstance: I use my phone for droning, and I’d already downloaded the JuiceSSH app when I was putting together a network diagnostic tools folder for general WiFi troubleshooting)."

In fact, when I remove the connection from the sonix board, the wifi access point SSID isn’t even broadcast, likely because at that point there is no power to the sonix board which has the wifi. I plugged the cable back in and powered it back up and everything is back to my original problem.  I see the are four connectors, could a single wire cause this? I did notice that the metal case of the sonix board is really hot when the battery is connected, is that normal? I did download juice ssh and was able to properly connect to the telnet session and get all the commands and whatnot from my phone (don’t have computer), but I don’t really know how to troubleshoot through that session.  When I checked mavlink status it did say zero sent and received at 625000. See attached file"

Someone told me to reconnect the GPS board. I looked at the connector and two of the female pins had slide backwards just enough to break contact. Once I fixed the bent lock tabs and reassembled it started working fine.

A while back I’d asked them why no SV reviews, pointing out the 2450 GPS and got a ‘Yeah, we should probably do that’. Kinda feel like if t isn’t sent to them for free by a sponsor then no review. Not that they should try an eval of every drone out there but a common drone anyone can pickup at Walmart or Target might warrant a consideration.

If you have a micro-SD card, you can put it into the skyviper in the slot just above the battery holder on the back.

On the drop down, select “All” then search for the paramater ""LOG_DISARMED"" Change it to 1 then “leave” the text box (it’ll automatically write) Now unplug your SV, insert the SD card (if not already) and perform the Tx binding again. After it unbinds. While still in the web interface, click the big SKY VIPER banner at the top. Then click “Filesystem” -> DATAFLASH -> And find the .bin file.  There should only be 1 since you’ve never flown before. If there isn’t, then just get the “last” one. The file should be small so you probably can upload it straight onto this site.

157,A tale of 3 Skyvipers : Another motor and gear issue,1,"My first 2450GPS , the wife bought for me at Christmas from Costco here in Canada .  Worked and flew great from the get go. It did suffer from two hard crashes early in its life , due to dumb me hitting the power button and disarming it in mid air . This resulted in a broken right front arm , was able to repair with glue and tape , but turns out this motor was also damaged as it would some times not spin after arming .   Replaced that motor and once again drone flew great until  around end of May .  It seemed to lack power and developed bad shake in video , I assumed that rest of the motors were now worn to point that they would need to be replaced . The Wife not looking forward to having to help my trembling hands solder a joint on those tiny wires again , ordered an other Skyviper from Amazon reseller, Sweet! It arrived in short order , paperwork said it was used / open for testing . This one was also the Costco version with extra battery and included SD card  I noticed right away that this Viper was very noisy , gear chatering and super twitchy flight  and bad jello video. Close inspection reveled that rotating the props with my fingers that one prop would hit a rough spot and stop , turns out the pinion on that motor was missing 3 or 4 teeth . Easy fix to replace with a pinion from Viper * Noisy chatter went away but video was  still quite jello’y. Checking free spin by hand that prop still catches a bit . I thought perhaps the teeth on  73 tooth main gear could also be damaged .I swapped it out with one from Viper # 1 as well . Checking free spin by hand it still has a rough spot were it seems to bind . I’m lost as to what is causing this  is it a bad motor ? In the mean time vendor had emailed Wife asking for feed back on order,she told them about issue with pinion they immediately offered to ship another complete SkyViper  Awsome  thank you Amazon  , which is due arrive tomorrow so that will be Viper # 3 . Anyone have any thoughts on what is wrong with gears . Also what size and type are the little jst/molex plugs on motor wires are ?",I think it might be these *

157,A tale of 3 Skyvipers : Another motor and gear issue,3,"My first 2450GPS , the wife bought for me at Christmas from Costco here in Canada .  Worked and flew great from the get go. It did suffer from two hard crashes early in its life , due to dumb me hitting the power button and disarming it in mid air . This resulted in a broken right front arm , was able to repair with glue and tape , but turns out this motor was also damaged as it would some times not spin after arming .   Replaced that motor and once again drone flew great until  around end of May .  It seemed to lack power and developed bad shake in video , I assumed that rest of the motors were now worn to point that they would need to be replaced . The Wife not looking forward to having to help my trembling hands solder a joint on those tiny wires again , ordered an other Skyviper from Amazon reseller, Sweet! It arrived in short order , paperwork said it was used / open for testing . This one was also the Costco version with extra battery and included SD card  I noticed right away that this Viper was very noisy , gear chatering and super twitchy flight  and bad jello video. Close inspection reveled that rotating the props with my fingers that one prop would hit a rough spot and stop , turns out the pinion on that motor was missing 3 or 4 teeth . Easy fix to replace with a pinion from Viper * Noisy chatter went away but video was  still quite jello’y. Checking free spin by hand that prop still catches a bit . I thought perhaps the teeth on  73 tooth main gear could also be damaged .I swapped it out with one from Viper # 1 as well . Checking free spin by hand it still has a rough spot were it seems to bind . I’m lost as to what is causing this  is it a bad motor ? In the mean time vendor had emailed Wife asking for feed back on order,she told them about issue with pinion they immediately offered to ship another complete SkyViper  Awsome  thank you Amazon  , which is due arrive tomorrow so that will be Viper # 3 . Anyone have any thoughts on what is wrong with gears . Also what size and type are the little jst/molex plugs on motor wires are ?",Thanks for the help folks .
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,1,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,"I guess I should be more specific.  I’m talking about the current 2450gps model, not the 2018 Journey model which I see from the early release manual does have a follow me mode.  The current model has the ability to locate the smart phone in the video app.  You can select Return to Home which takes it to the launch location or Return to Me which will bring it to the smart phone, even if you have moved from the original location but when it gets there, it wants to land instead of hover, and it wants to land heading in the direction it had at launch. You programmers should be able to tweek this capability into a full blown follow me mode."
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,2,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,"using Solex, you can do follow me mode. but it costs $20. Tower used to work, but then Android made a change to the location API and broke it. I know how to fix it, but don’t have the ability to get my changes pushed to either dronekit-android or the Tower repo. anyways, Solex will do it. Also, the SV’s video in Solex is better. lower frame loss."
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,3,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,Solex has a lot to offer but I don’t have a SOLO.  How difficult is it to adapt to the Skyviper 2450gps?

158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,8,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,"Also, the 2450GPS will already do it using Solex.  It used to work with Tower, but Android changed somethign in their Location API, which caused it to stop working. I started a PR to try to fix it, but it takes fixing both a Tower component and a dronekit-android component. And Tower dev is basically non-existent."
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,9,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,I hadn’t heard of Solex.  $30 is a bit steep but it does look nice.  Does the video feed happen to work with the SkyViper?
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,10,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,"It does. I’ve been having issues with the latest version, but still a good App that is actually maintained by the developer."
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,11,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,"Thanks.  That sounds even more interesting then.  Has the developer explicitly expanded the scope of the app to include non-solo use?  Or is it just working to the extent that generic mavlink protocol is used? What are the issues you are having in the current version?  It’s not normally possible to get an older version and while I might be willing to pay that much for something that works well, it’s way too much for just an experiment. Thanks!"
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,12,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,"It has a specific setting to tell it whether it is a Solo or a Skyviper. And then it also has a “Generic” setting as well which will just operate off the available MavLink connection. The solo and Skyviper setup works with the Solo and SV camera controls and such though, which is nicely integrated. I’m having issues with sometimes the app crashing, but only when i’m using my skyviper. I think the issue might stem from my SV being loaded with AC 3.6 R2, rather than stock…but i’m not sure. I don’t get enough time to test scenarios. Generally, when I have time to fly I just go outside, throw it in the air and go! lol To be complete, I’ll say that I use Tower more than I use Solex, mainly becuause I can use it to do auto-missions for free… Solex is great though, because the “voice prompts” work (Tower sometimes doesn’t), also Follow-me works, and of course the video works!"
158,Follow Me Mode? It would be fun,13,Is it possible to set my Skyviper to follow me around as I move?,I did notice the in-app purchase notice.  They charge extra for auto missions on top of the $30?   Wow.  That’s hard to justify.  How much extra and is there anything else they charge extra for?

Suggestions?,"You have to remember that the failsafe will not let you go beyond signal strength of the controler. So you could disable the fence. But if it detects a drop in signal from the controler it will just stop going any higher. You would need to find a way to increase the signal distance. Or it could also be interference from a nearby source, so try other locations to make sure signal has no interference. I’ve only managed 163.9 then I got the controler telling me i had lost signal.

Suggestions?,"The fence is unrelated to loss of signal failsafe.  Even if you were to establish an 800 ft fence radius, the Viper will head for home if it loses command control signal.  If a home has not been established because you have launched before GPS lock has been established, it will just land if out of signal range.  However, Mission Planner can be set to ignore loss of control signal if the Viper is flying under GPS control on a planned Mission.  It does not need a control signal to guide it since the flight plan is on board and MP is providing the instructions. Try setting up a flight plan with a waypoint near your takeoff point and set an altitude of 200’ or whatever is your local limit.  Battery capacity and air density should be the limit. I have not tried testing altitude limits but I have flown missions well beyond the horizontal signal range."

Suggestions?,"You probably won’t get any higher than that using the controller, cuz you’ll lose signal. But you could potentially get higher by using Mission Planner and runnuing a mission up to a higher altitude. You’ll need to change the Parameter FS_THR_ENABLE to 2 - Enabled Continue with Mission in Auto Mode. There is a risk here of course.  If you set the Waypoint height to 1000ft, and it can’t get there…it’ll keep trying until the battery dies…and if it is out of radio range, you won’t be able to call it back."

It is triggered below BATT_LOW_VOLT (Note: You may not want to react to this first one. On my SV, I’ve found that if you go “Fast” that’ll the battery Volt will temporarily drop below this and cause Low alert, but then will go back up when you release the throttles.) BATT_FS_CRT_ACT - This is the last chance to get on the ground. It is triggered below BATT_CRT_VOLT BTW, this is only specific to the SV. Each craft is build differently. For example, the 3DR Solo has a SMBus smart battery to tell when the battery is low.  Other crafts may have both current and voltage sensors, etc."

163,Unbricking a SkyViper transmitter,1,"A bug has been found in the SkyViper transmitter firmware which can cause the transmitter to “brick”.

This bug has been reported here: *  * (and perhaps in other places) we will be releasing an updated firmware soon that will prevent the problem from happening, but in the meanwhile I am posting instructions here on how to fix your transmitter. Fixing the Issue To test quickly if your transmitter can be fixed you should power it on while holding the left shoulder button (the one marked with a video camera) and also holding the left stick fully down (as though doing zero throttle). If the transmitter starts up and does its startup tones then the unbricking procedure listed below will work. This combination of buttons puts the transmitter into factory test mode with factory test channel 3. It is a bit of a complex procedure, so follow the steps carefully. The fix is as follows:  connect to the web interface on the SkyViper at http://192.168.99.1/ using a web browser on your computer Go to the system control page at http://192.168.99.1/system.html  Change your WiFi channel to 9 press ‘Set SSID and Password’ navigate to the parameters page at http://192.168.99.1/parameters.html  Choose the ‘Radio’ parameter category Change the parameter BRD_RADIO_TESTCH to ‘TestChan3’  It will look like this:  *  Now reboot your SkyViper (pull the battery plug out and put it back in) While holding in the the left shoulder button (the video button) on the transmitter and holding the left stick fully down power on the transmitter  At this point the transmitter will power on and will connect to your SkyViper. Now you should leave both the transmitter and SkyViper powered on for one full minute. After one minute go back to the ‘Radio’ section of the parameters in the web UI and change BRD_RADIO_TESTCH to ‘Disabled’. Then power off both your SkyViper and your transmitter and power them back on again. Your SkyViper should now function normally. Explanation There was a bug in the transmitter firmware related to high WiFi channel numbers that tries to avoid conflicts between RC transmitter channels and WiFi channels. If the WiFi channel number was set to 11 or higher than it would fail to complete the code that selects a channel for the transmitter on boot. Forcing a fixed channel with factory test mode allows us to fix the problem.","With Mission Planner you can fly with a connected game controller, but there are some potential gotchas there. I’ve done it inside my house for fun. You can also just connect Mission Planner (and others I’m sure) to the SV over MAVLink and command it through the Actions menu.  It works, and I’ve done it, but you better be watching it! You cannot “Arm” in Auto mode, so you’ll need to ARM it in Loiter (after GPS lock) and use the game controller to take off and hover, then switch to “Auto” mode to fly the mission. Using the game controller you’ll need to hold the throttle down to arm, because the throttle has to be “0” to pass pre-arm checks (unless you disable, but not recommended)"

165,V2450GPS battery reporting false percentage? No low battery alarm on controller either,1,"Okay. So I’ve used my iPhone 6 and my OnePlus 5T and both of the apps always report my batteries as 87% at all times. I have two batteries and both of them have this issue, so I assume it’s the drone. I never get the low battery alarm on my transmitter either, even when it gets to the point where the drone can’t even get off the ground (I assume this is really bad for these LiPo batteries!!!). Any ideas?","The “first” battery alarm is a flaw in the Skyviper App not the drone or the battery. It is EXTREMELY conservative at best, and flawed at worse. I’m sure the company feels it’s better to be safe than have customer’s drones fall out of the sky, but generally the App will start annoying you when there is still 80% battery left. Also, if you switch to a Sport mode, the motors will temporarily cause the battery level to drop when you push hard, which will trigger the alarm as well. If you switch to Solex ($30 which sucks) it’ll be much more accurate the the SkyViper App, and won’t have the annoying alarms…BUT you’ll lose the automatic UBLOX GPS file download which allows your SV to lock on much faster. Also, through logging I’ve been able to pinpoint exactly what the battery voltage is right before the motors quit working, and I adjusted my Battery failsafe down significantly to get some more uninterrupted flight time.  It is set at like 3.43 from the factory, but I pulled it down to be 3.37. That was conservative and ensures that on a windy day i have enough power to get back and land gently.  I could have pulled it down a view more mVs, but I decided to stay safe.  It’ll pretty much drop out of the sky at 3.33v.  If you’re not getting the low battery alarm, then for some reason your battery fail safe may be disabled. Look for these parameters. source: * FS_BATT_VOLTAGE: Failsafe battery voltage Battery voltage to trigger failsafe. Set to 0 to disable battery voltage failsafe. If the battery voltage drops below this voltage then the copter will RTL Increment	Units 0.1	volt          Default for SV: 3.43 (i think) FS_BATT_ENABLE: Battery Failsafe Enable Controls whether failsafe will be invoked when battery voltage or current runs low Values Value	Meaning 0	Disabled 1	Land 2	RTL 3	SmartRTL or RTL   (Default for SV) 4	SmartRTL or Land Btw, this battery is a “dumb” battery and doesn’t report anything on its own.

I did use a TAKE OFF command at * and a LAND command at #7 (don’t know why 1 and 7 don’t show up) Where are the log files that might explain this? One other note . . . when I inspected the craft afterwards, one of the motors would not run. Don’t know if it was damaged from impact or failed in flight since both of these possibilities would be new for me. The SV just pancaked to the ground . . . is this what motor failure would do, without pitching? UPDATE:  This must be what classic motor failure looks like. Ran same route on new SV and completed the circuit 3 complete times and almost to WP3 on the 4th (then Critical Battery Level returned to home) in a 15mph wind. Really moves going downwind!

Even less encouraging and a bit confusing, we were making a stop this morning at the Target where I purchased it for about $50 so figured I may as well check if it was showing the new price yet and found that it is once again reporting $99.  I can understand why it might have been removed from the system at my store if it was going on clearance soon, but why is it now back at the old price? Now I’m wondering if the customer service person who sold it to me for $49 even knew what she was talking about when she said it was no longer in the system because it was being “clearanced out”. I’m happy to have found a spare for $50, but I’m sorry if I got everyone’s hopes up prematurely! The store is close enough that we tend to shop nearly every week, so I may as well keep the UPC code in my pocket…"

Sonix board requires this step to do so. It will load firmware from SD card, if bootloader pad (TP4 in Kevin’s post) is pulled down when powered on. Pull down means to connect it to ground. I did not take picture, but step will be like this.  Temporarily solder thin wire to SD card slot metal part (‘GND’ in his photo). Copy FIRMWARE_660R_F.bin to the root of SD card. Connect battery while the other end of wire touching the pad. If this boot process goes well, firmware file should be erased but I do not remember well. "

WiFi is working again. It was indeed the lower pad (TP4). It had a weak pull-up on it, so I pulled it down with a jumper. The upper one (TP5) was already at 0V. I might have left the jumper on for too long though. It seemed to reboot a whole bunch of times after flashing. Unfortunately, I didn’t keep a log of those printouts and my memory is quite volatile. The firmware upgrade web page showed that the ArduPilot version was 2017-07-29 (3.6.0-dev 6fc59437) and the transmitter at 2017-07-24. I didn’t record the version of the Sonix board firmware before I bricked it, but presumably it had a similar version as well? Is this an expected firmware version? I updated to the current latest (and also stable?) of 2017-10-14 dfd2d838 on the Sonix, 2017-10-14 (3.6.0-dev d84c8a4f of ArduPilot, and 2017-10-14 of transmitter. I’ll see if I can reliably * in the next few days with the latest firmware and maybe with the other version. Thanks for the very prompt response.

Did it do that? Or did you not use the app? thanks. The only thing I can think of now is if the string for SSID or password managed to break the parser in the sonix wifi lib, and that causes it to crash when starting wifi. Do you know what wifi SSID and password you set?"

If not, try formatting the microSD through the web interface. In my case, the microSD worked for bootloading, but not for anything else until the format. It showed up as 0 GB though the web interface. All the while, it was broadcasting it’s own SSID. A good indicator of the filesystem being good seems to be that a SKYVIPER folder is created and the photo and video recording works (recording did not work for me before).

I don’t have it hardwired via USB right now so can’t see much. But will solder soon … I  upgraded from an old (8/26) version and after that  the network disappeared, so now I know WIFI.TXT is read. Doubt it’s the SD card, when in access mode I can see the file system fine. But can never see WIFI.TXT since I have wifi connection only … It’s got to be something with dhcp, weird thing though is that it won’t access either a wifi router or my phone as hotspot. I also tried re-formatting and downloading from the web server, but no different. And could see WIFI.TXT just fine before rebooting. Interesting that you have it working tethered to your phone but not your router. Definitely must have something to do with dhcp … Probably same with me, but can’t explain why it wouln’t work with my phone either. Console will hopefully tell!"

I’m actually surprised at the level of interest in station mode. Now that I know people are interested, I could look at a different method of setting it up. The reason I used WIFI.TXT instead of just putting it in the video board NVRAM parameters is I needed to give some way to recover in case it didn’t work. As there is no button on the copter the obvious method was the microSD. I could do something like have a setting in the NVRAM interface in the web page, but it only activates if it has been enabled in the web interface and the drone is booted while upside down. Would that be better?"

There seems to be a lot of “finickiness” (is that a word) to the WebApp and firmware. One wrong move and the whole thing stops working.  All of the firmware code needs a “recovery” mode which it branches to anytime a startup function fails.

Power up your skyviper, and connect your laptop to the skyviper network.   Fire up a browser to 192.168.99.1. You will then get a web interface to the skyviper, see camera output, etc …   Reprogram your transmitter to have one button or button press combination assigned to mode “auto” for an autonomous mission.

Your viper will then connect to your home network. You can then assign it a permanent ip address (by configuring static dhcp on your router for the viper with its MAC address), you will have to sniff it from ip traffic (e.g with tcpdump, look for 14500 udp packets) to find its MAC adress. Then connect your web browser to that IP address, instead of 192.168.99.1). Assigning a permanent IP address on you router is optional,.

188,No XYZ values for magnetometer,1,Where is the magnetometer located in the SV? I believe the one in mine has stopped functioning. I tried doing a calibration and the fixed was successful but no change. The rotating never shows a progress bar and yes I held the SV out and twisted around for several mins and nothing. Mag sensor values are all 0. All other calibrations are successful. Connected to MP and I get Bad Compass Health which I got once before but a run through calibrations fixed. I don’t find any log type files on the SD card.,It’s on the GPS board.  Try reseating the connectors.

189,Rolls and flips,1,Has anyone adjusted settings to do rolls and flips? If so what settings did you find worked for you? Here is my attempt at practising a few rolls . ,"(Can’t watach video on work network, so some of my questions are probably answerd by it) ACRO_Y_EXPO <-- This doesn’t affect roll and flips, but makes it more…thrilling? lol Be careful with this one. ACRO_TRAINER <-- Did you change this? It defaults to 2, which won’t allow you to Roll. I sdet mine to 1, so that when i let go of the sticks it’ll attempt to “save me”.  But, warning, it doesn’t “save me” very quickly…basically, once you’ve controlled it back level, it’ll help stabilize to drone for the next maneuver. ACRO_RP_EXPO <-- Play with this one until it is roll/pitch fast enough for your liking.  If you go “very high” it might go so fast you cannot control it (or break from torqueing?)  I think I set mine to 0.3, but probably should be 0.4.  I can flip and roll but I lose about 30-60ft depending on the wind. ALWAYS have a lot of altitude lol. ACRO_RP_P <-- This is your “Base roll/pitch” speed.  The parameter above some how affects this one way or another.  I don’t remember what I set this to, but I bumped it up a few ticks from the default. ACRO_BAL_ROLL <-- How fast it’ll try to return to level when you release the sticks.  You know the SV is capable of extremely fast recovery, if you’ve ever tried Throw mode, so this will likely save your butt when you get out of wack.  Recommend playing with this and trainer mode until you become a “pro”…or until you’re ready to kill your SV "

Tho to do this I need to remove the camera. But I see it’s all wired into a sealed board. Is there a way I can just disconect or can I just cut it out without affecting any other systems? * *,"I’m certainly not an expert, but I believe you’ll have to remove the Sonix board completely to remove the camera.  The problem there being you’re going to lose the APWeb, Wifi and more, because all of that is part of the Sonix board.  I’ve thought similar thoughts. I looked into trying to replace the camera with the RunCam Split mini…or RunCam Split 2 which may be better because that already has a wifi module. You’ll still lose APWeb, but that’s ok, you can still change parameters and do calibrations and such with Mission Planner.  I haven’t looked really hard into it, but the power requirements for the split 2 might be equivalent to the Sonix…but probably a little higher, so you’ll lose some flight time. Edit: I didn’t know much about the board you posted, but it looks pretty cool, and clearly already has a wireless cape, for FPV goggles. So i guess if you already have compatible goggles, that makes the most sense.  I’m having a hard time picturing the dimensions of that board though, and whether it’ll fit in the nose of the SV.  Either way, you’ll still need to remove the Sonix board. I’d very much like to see a full article build on this, as once I finally kill my SV through crazy flying, I’ll finally be willing to start doing some modding. "

The only advantage you’re getting by keeping it is the APWeb. And, by leaving it, you’re still having to power it with the 1S battery already on board.  This new camera also requires 1S power. I don’t know the power consumption of the Sonix board, but likely they are pretty close. So you won’t sacrifice flight time. Is there a reason you want to keep the Sonix? I have no idea, but I would think there is a chance the Sonix firmware may not work quite right with a snipped camera ribbon cable.  Looks like a fun project, let me know how it goes."

After upgrading to a non-skyviper version of AP, the Skyviper app doesn’t work anymore.  It has nothing to do with compatibility, but the App sees that your version isn’t their latest verison and gives you a popup asking if you want to upgrade the firmware. On the popup, it gives you a nice “skip” button…but it is greyed out.  Score another one for Skyviper app bugs. Also, and this was my stupidity (or maybe ignorance). After loading the SV with master, I opened the Flight parameters page and it appeared that all my parameters were still there. So i assumed that the parameters must not be overwritten…then today I did an RTL…and let it come all the way and land…and it BANGED into the ground extremely hard.  I have no idea why. My handling had been VERY flawless the whole time…so clearly there were some parameters set correctly.  But, for some reason it just slammed extremely hard. Unfortunately I did not have the SD card in because I’m…dumb. So I noticed that on the RTL descent, it still did the quick drop, then slowed at about 10m, then instead of a slow steady descent to the touchdown it came down fast…but even if the settings were wrong, it should have had an idea of where the ground was right? Or maybe it did, and these tiny brushed motors just aren’t strong enough to quickly stop a descent…anyways…it appears to still be alive lol"

198,SV drifts a lot right after a 'long' fast maneuver,1,"So I’ve noticed a lot that when in GPS Hold:On mode that if I move in a single direction for a period of time (4-5 seconds) especially really fast, that when I let go of the stick that it’ll continue to drift in that direction.

So have I been a complete melt and got the wrong motors or is there something else wrong?","Hi Lee, I’m guessing these aren’t strong enough. Or one of the set may be really weak. Here’s one way to check for a weak motor in the set: connect to the SkyviperGPS SSID via your phone or computer and open a browser to 192.168.99.1 and this will connect you to the web AP (access point). Click on System Status, then select the motors tab. Set the throttle level lower to a value of 20% and spin up each motor individually. Now ‘listen’ to the motors as they spin. If one of the motors is super weak, you will hear a difference. When you have a weak motor in the set, it will bring all other motors down to its level in order to compensate during flight. If you keep the frame held down, or remove the props, you can bring the throttle value up and the ‘sound’ of what you are listening for may be more clear. Each motor has a harmonic, or frequency sound, as it powers. You’ll feel a little bit like a ‘motor whisperer’ as you do this, but you will be able to tell pretty easily if one of these guys is weaker. As for other types of motors, I’ve put some MMW motors in my frame and they sing beautifully! These were the ones I tried: *  Pricey, but MMW motors are very nice. I also noticed that a set of RaceStar motors I got for evaluation had the exact same stamp on the bottom of the motors. The symbol translates to something like HI MAX and I found the company that manufactures these, but they only sell them to branding partners like MMW or RaceStar. It’s sadly the joy of dealing with brushed motors… if they get obstructed, they heat up fast and will slowly destroy themselves internally resulting is decreased performance. Hope that helps!"

This time, the motor was a little bit tight coming out.  The new one would not go back in.  There was severe interference between the pinion and the driven gear. Careful inspection showed no damage to either gear but the gears would not slip into mesh. I tried another spare motor, same result.  I tried the original motor with the original gear from the right rear.  It would not fit either.  I then tried the new motor with the swapped gear in the right rear position and it fit.

I have a fairly well equipped “hobby” machine shop which includes a set of #size and wire gauge drill bits and a precision micrometer to measure them with.

If the props get obstructed, say in a tree branch or really tall grass, the motors will get very hot, as they are brushed motors. While we have some code in place to prevent obstruction, it can be overruled by user input, rocking the stick side to side, for example. Yes, these motors can become hot enough to change the pliable nature of the plastic when obstructed. Add to that, when you replace motors, you should replace the whole set, as our Viper motors are custom builds, it’s hard to find a matching motor from third party. This will cause the new motor to probably work hard to match the others. I think your best bet might be to get a heat gun and slowly, gradually apply heat to the plastic area and (with a motor in place) try getting the gears closer together. Be mindful that you don’t warp the arm, though, as that will affect the plane of the propeller. Also, since it sounds like you have a nice shop, I’d recommend getting a nice set of Calipers for measurement. Don’t get a crappy set from Amazon… we keep sending those back. The best ones are made in Japan. Hope that helps, Matt"

I have been able to avoid trees and I use the lid from a plastic tub for takeoff but RTL usually puts it down in the grass.  The last time that I flew, I was flying very long and high missions that pushed the limit of battery capacity.  I had several batteries and I flew consecutive missions.  The last flight ended with an unplanned landing. I was using a battery that I thought may be failing so I thought that had been the problem so I didn’t inspect the Skyviper for damage.  The following day, with batteries recharged, the right-front failed to start up on arming. Measuring is important in a machine shop.  I have a wide variety of calipers for inside and outside calipers but I consider digital calipers to be second to a good micrometer in accuracy.  Access to the measurement area is usually the big problem when deaiing with micro machines. Gauge wires are commonly used to measure gear clearance tand the shank of small drill bits serve as a good substitute for gauge wires. In this case, the gears are to close together so I must move them apart. A heated scriber point pressed into the plastic between the motor and the prop shaft may do the trick but I will wait for more response from Skyrocket before I try that."

I noticed that the first time I changed a motor. Not the problem here.  There is a distortion in the frame.  Looking and testing further, I have found two things.  There seems to be a misalignment of the shafts caused by the heat. The bottom of the motor is farther from the prop shaft axis than the top of the motor.  That causes the top of the motor with the pinion to tilt in.  The other thing I see is that the inside surface of the motor seat is covered with small raised blisters, helping to push the motor towards the prop.  If I had a 8.5mm reamer, it would be easy to clean up the bore, but I don’t.  That translates to .3346"" which falls between 5/16"" and 3/8"".  I have some adjustable reamers but they require a through hole which would take out the shoulder stop that holds the motor.  I may have to grind a custom hand reamer to do this right."

I could not get that measurement but I could get a very accurate measurement of the spacing difference at the two locations.  Here is how I did It.  I used two new motors without pinion gears, one in each location.  There is a gap between the bare motor shaft and the prop gear. I could measure the difference in the two by finding what wire gauge could be placed in the tooth spacing of the prop gear that would just pass by the motor shaft.  A wire size .057"" would pass the “good” location but not the “bad” location.  The “bad” location would only pass a .049"" wire size.  A difference of .008"" which is more than enough to prevent the gears from passing. I have a fairly well equipped “hobby” machine shop which includes a set of #size and wire gauge drill bits and a precision micrometer to measure them with.  It doesn’t give the shaft spacing and is only an approximation of the gap spacing but it is a very accurate measure of the difference.","I know for a fact that we don’t have frames to sell.

I did grind a hand reamer and made some progress getting the bore cleaned up but the tilt is another matter.  I did get the gears to mesh but it probably needs another .002"" to run freely.  The motors will arm but the right front stops almost immediately when disarmed. It will fly and hold stable at altitude, but the flight time was less than three minutes on a full battery. Too much power draw leading to more heat and more dead motors. Send me a scrap frame if you can. Let me know the cost."

213,Autotune Succesful?,1,How long does an Autotune sequence take?  I just finished a flight with my Skyviper which I switched to autotune as soon as it took off. I started at an altitude of about 6 feet in light wind.The copter twitched in both pitch and roll and then did some yaw movements. It then flew several circles around the launch position. It did a few more pitch and roll movements and then circled again while keeping the nose to the circle center.  It then did an RTL that may have been the end of the sequence or it may have been triggered by a low battery.  I took off to try a few manual manuevers but the low battery kicked in again and it landed.  Total time of the flight about 6 minutes.,Typically longer than that. Sometimes a lot longer although I have never tried it with my SkyViper. Set the Autoune_axis parameter for a single axis and do them sequentially with a fresh battery each time.

There is certainly a science of PIDs…but it really only gets you so far (although I’m sure there are some people out there that can math out some PID coefficients exactly) but we would always calculate what PID was needed…then tweak it for hours and hours until we got it handling how we wanted.  And that was only on two axes! Much props (pun?) to the people who did this work. The SV handles beautifully out of the box.

Just took this two seconds ago. You see I’m not an Idiot. While I’m new to quad and RCs I’ve been doing software testing for aircraft avionics for 12 years including flight testing. I have made a living on testing software and reporting both functional and performance bugs. The app software is buggy. The battery level is always wrong, the signal level is almost always 0. The video stutters and freezes. And I’m not talking recording, I’m talking using the life video to fly the drone. It’ll work fine for a few minutes then get worse and worse. While I can attribute some to my older phone, my tablet is very powerful and does the same thing.  However I believe the point is that a company representative shouldn’t behave in such ways, especially towards people who have been advocating for the brand. Criticism of part of a product should be welcomed to help improve the brand, especially when it comes from customers who are already happy with the product."

Has anyone done it yet?","I purchased single samples of a few types of cells from IMR and have been experimenting as well.  Here is what I see so far. First, I removed a small amount of weight, perhaps 4.5 grams, from my second SV in the form of the battery holder (See my battery holder post) and the top plastic shroud (no clips, just 4 screws after you remove the bottom cover and the camera board).  The prop guards would add about 10 grams if I ever used them so I figure I should have about 15 grams headroom without exceeding stock weight.  This thing seems to fly pretty close to it’s weight limit to begin with so every gram counts.  I’ve also noticed with the heavier cells, it can’t maintain hover below about 3.1 volts.  This is not just because of the internal protection in the stock battery.  I haven’t yet checked the logs, but I suspect if you do you will see that the highest output motor in this condition is at almost 100%.  I also set FS_BATT_VOLTAGE to 3.0 for my tests.  Voltages were measured via wifi/mavlink telemetry.  My test hover is performed outside and sometimes includes some wind so results do vary.  I also do a short rapid climb every minute or so to get a feel for how much headroom we have on motor power and to make times more realistic than a static hover.  The extra current draw from the climb is sometimes enough to drop the voltage/power enough to cause the end of the hover.  Reported weight includes JST connector and wire.  I solder directly to positive terminal and side of battery case (as quickly as I can to avoid heat spread).  I suspect such abuse is frowned on but I have no way to weld it and I bought cells without tabs.  My conclusions and measurements are below: Stock battery, rated 1200 mAh:  27g, Based on testing I also find that about 9 minutes is maximum safe flight time, flys very well with fairly comfortable power: Reduced weight SV flew for 10:12 before test hover could no longer be maintained.  The voltage was about 3.0v immediately before landing but bounced back to about 3.4v just a few minutes after landing.  I put 1123 mAh back into it afterwards.  No significant swelling of the cell, but I suspect I’ve reduced it’s working life.  No cell should be expected to run this close to it’s rated capacity for many cycles.  I won’t be repeating this test on a stock cell. Sanyo NCR18650GA 3500mAh 10A:  48g, No significant gain in flight time over stock.  Flew OK but feels sluggish and climbs a bit slowly: Voltage drop due low current rating is limiting factor. LG HD2 18650 2000mAh 25A Battery:  45g, Provides 12-13 minute flight times.  Flew fairly well, perhaps a bit sluggish: Hovered until 3.0v,  13:45 flight time required 1515 mAh charge.  Second test hovered 12:53, required 1480 mAh.  Capacity/voltage drop were limiting factors. Sony VTC6 18650 3000mAh 15A Battery:  49g, Provides about 15 min flight.  Feels sluggish, climbs slowly: Hovered until 3.1v, 15:45 flight time, required 1770 mah.  Current draw/voltage drop/weight were all limiting factors. EFAN 20700 4300mAh Battery:  63g, Rated 15A.  Could barely get off the ground and flew for only a few seconds: Just too heavy and not enough current! Sanyo NCR20650A 3100mAh 30A Battery:  53g, Flew for perhaps 3 minutes.  Didn’t bother recording the details: Too heavy. It looks like 45g might be about the sweet spot.  At this weight, we can lighten things so we are only about 3 grams over the weight the stock drone flys indoors with the prop guards without removing parts. At this weight, it looks like we need a cell that can supply 8 amps all the way down to 3 volts.  The power which can be supplied at 7-8 amps before we reach this voltage will determine the maximum flight time. I also have a 30c 2000 mAh 2S lipo pack on order which should come in at about 45g after I separate the cells.  (Why is it so difficult to find high current 1s packs?)  I’m hopeful this may provide a reliable 15 minute flight with some headroom. I may try some more Li-Ion cells as well if I can find some more on the light side with high enough current.  I’m guessing they may be less prone to damage through high drain/low voltage. –Brad"

Satoru_Sasaki, (and brad112358) strange you can only consume about 1/2 capacity. According to Panasonic specs for a LI-ION  18650 GA, for instance, voltage at 1/2 consumed capacity should be in the 3.3v range (at 10amps discharge). Notably lower than comparable LIPO at same discharge btw. I know those curves are to be taken with a grain of salt, but still, you should be able to get a solid 3000mAH out of a 18650GA, I wonder if hardware battery cut-off (Tridge mentioned there was such a mechanism to prevent over discharge?) can explain some of this? And answer your question as to why Viper is landing early irrespective of what you set voltage failsafe at? But then again you mention landing at 3V and not 3.3V or higher, so this would not fully explain it. Hmmm … The other culprit has got to be the added weight, shooting up current consumption and thus lowering  that red voltage curve way too much."

Has anyone done it yet?","I don’t think failing to maintain altitude at 3 volts is any mystery.  As your graph shows (and as I had guessed in an earlier post), one of the motor outputs reaches 100% in hover at this voltage indicating power is insufficient to maintain hover at this voltage/weight.  Note that available power is roughly proportional to the square of the voltage so it drops more quickly than you might think between 4 and 3 volts. BTW, I did receive the 2000 mAh LiPo pack I ordered last night and got one flight in this morning, so I have one more data point to add to my previous tests: Venom Fly 30C 2S 2000mAh (reworked cell): 41.5g, Provides about 14 minutes flight,  Flies pretty well: In windy conditions, I lost hover after a quick climb at 3.0 volts, 14:25 flight time.  It required 1680 mAh to charge.  The limiting factor here seems to be internal resistance.  I don’t believe the capacity or 30c claims the manufacture makes, but the result here is still pretty good. Note, dividing a commercial multi-cell pack into 1S configuration is not a task to be undertaken lightly.  Much care must be taken not to puncture the wrap, or short or overheat the tabs while separating and then soldering new leads.  Use a heat-sink on the cell end of the tabs when soldering.  Also, take advantage of the existing solder because soldering on bare aluminum tabs requires special procedures/materials.  I made the mistake of separating the tabs joining the two cells at the edge of the soldered area and had a very difficult time getting solder to stick to the tab that was left bare.  I think it would be much better to cut the soldered region in half, leaving some soldered area on the tabs of both cells and making soldering the new JST battery lead much easier. Overall, I think this is my best outcome so far as the flight time is almost as long and the SV flies much better at this weight than it did with the heavier, 49g Sony VTC6 even though the Sony flew longer.  All-up weight after removing the plastic I mentioned earlier is about the same as flying stock with the prop guards installed. I do have a few more samples of 18650 cells on order, all at 45g or less this time.  I will post again when I have more test results to report."

The metal can the cell is sealed in is ferromagnetic which means, as opposed to LiPo cells, even when no current is being drawn, they can interfere with the operation of the compass which is critical to correct operation in loiter mode.  Some cells are worse than others.  I have been using a powerful degausser designed for bulk erasure of magnetic tape with mixed results.

This brings the total weight to 4 grams more than the stock drone would be with out the prop guards and without my weight reductions. There was less wind and the 41.5 g 2000mAh LiPo flew for 14:20 before it could no longer hover.  1677 mAh were required to charge. Then I flew with just two of the prop guards.  This simulates stock weight.  The 2000mAh LiPo flew for 15:01 and required 1690 mAh to charge. Then I flew with no prop guards.  This is 5g less than stock weight, the same as my earlier post.  It flew for 15:20 and required 1730 mAh to charge.  Note, this was better than my first test on Thursday, perhaps because of the lighter wind. The voltage drops to 3.0 volts just before it looses the ability to hover, but it rebounds to 3.6 volts after resting a few minutes.  It seems cell damage is not likely even when this battery is flown in the SV until it can’t maintain altitude.  I think setting the fail-safe voltage at about 3.2 volts should work well for this configuration. So, to answer your question, the 5 gram weight reduction I did does help, but you can expect about 14 minutes of flight time with this battery, even with the stock weight (without prop guards). I also flew again with the Sony VTC6 with 2 prop guards (to bring it up to stock weight), but I got significantly less flight time than I saw the first day I tested this cell.  I only got 12:30 flight time and the cell only accepted 1522 mAh charge afterwards.  It seems the extra weight caused the voltage to drop much faster or perhaps the internal resistance of the cell has increased due to wear, or something else went wrong.  In general, this cell is too heavy for decent performance anyway so I will not be using it for further testing. EDIT:  A later flight with the Sony cell seemed to land itself at about 7.5 minutes.  But I noticed the voltage was still high enough that it should have been able to fly.  I took off again and it flew for another 7-8 minutes.  It seems the “something else went wrong” hypothesis above was the correct one.  I’m not sure why it descended.  Possibly GPS issues I was having caused the altitude estimate to be off.  I still think this cell is too heavy to fly well so I don’t recommend it. Still waiting for more Li-Ion samples to arrive."

There’s actually a  paper that was written a few years ago showing that theoretically you cannot increase flight time when weight of battery exceeds twice the weight of copter without battery. (Using plain physics, potential energy, etc …). In practice optimal flight time deviates from theoretical of course,  sometimes widely, depends on motors, props, etc … bit in some cases (not the Viper) I’ve seen it as a pretty good rule of thumb. In the case of the Viper doubling the batteries will get you more flight time, just not much, 2-3 more minutes I think, and control won’t be as good."

I decided to try some battery options.  I rigged up a parrallel harness and combined 3 750mAh batteries. One battery in the batt holder and the other two zip tie4d on below.  The combined voltage was at 4.08v.  I hand launched because it would not sit on the pad level.  It seemed to fly well but I am not into aggressive moves. Slow and stable is fine with me. I realized that I had forgotten to start the timer but it was too late now so I don’t have any comparrative numbers.  I fooled around for a while, taking it up to 170’ in POS_HOLD mode and it held position although it had to pitch hard to windward. Next up was a pair of 1200mAh batteries combined voltage 4.14v.  and this time I was prepared with the timer. Hand launch again because of the belly load but it flew normally, very steady and I  had no problem with handling and manueverability.  I kept it in a low hover close by as I was going to try to get a photo of the belly mounted batttery and I was most interrested in flight time. Suddenly it began to descend. I could not stop it with the throttle.  It hit the ground at 1min 12sec of flight…  I could get it to re-arm but it did not have the will to fly.  Battery voltage was 4.02 by the time I got in the shop.  I had no more time to work with it so I will get at it again tomorrow.  The combined weight of the batteries was within a few grams of the 3 750mAh batts so I expected similar results.  I did not expect it to give up after 1min or so. Any thoughts?"

Most likely explanation is that with the extra weight  your Viper could not deliver to the motors (or the motors could not produce enough mechanical power out,  with max electrical power in)  the required power (voltage x current) at that voltage to stop descending. If you have a log it will most likely confirm  the story, showing what the voltage in the air was."

I realize that voltage will rebound but I did not expect it to be so great.  I have the low voltage limit in the flight parameters set at 3.22v and I get enough warning for the RTL command to bring it home and land.  I suspect that there may be another answer which brings up another question. Today, I was flying with just one battery 1200mAh and the flight time was normal (about 7min) with the first battery up until the end of the flight. It was above 100ft and began to descend without my control.  i hit the RTL button and the Skyviper did respond as expected although it did not make the normal LOITER time before settling to the ground. I made a second flight using the second battery charged to 4.17v (same as the first) and it only lasted about two minutes before going into LAND mode and descending descending rapidly, ignoring all control attempts.  It seems to me that I have a bad battery that reports 4+ volts at rest but falls rapidly under load.  When paired with the other battery in parrallel, it sunk the combined voltage and if I knew how to interpret a log file it would probably show that, but I don’t."

You will see movement on the progress bar. The motion should be more of a rolling motion than a spinning motion. Depending on your flexibility, it may require an overhead repeat of the same motion.  If the bar does not succeed in reaching the right side of the box, you might consider hiring a Lotus Dancer to perform the manuever.

The SkyViper can work with a wide range of GCS software, including MissionPlanner, QGC, Tower, MAVProxy etc. For each of them, set them up to listen on UDP port 14550. The SkyViper uses MAVLink2 by default, which doesn’t work with some older GCS software (such as Tower). To use those GCS versions you need to change the parameter SERIAL1_PROTOCOL to 1 from the default of 2. That will allow MAVLink1 GCS implementations to connect. As the SkyViper uses UDP broadcasts you can connect from multiple devices at once. "

I have seen a few people say that when manually uploading a firmware to the FC that it can wipe out the default flight parameters. I wonder if whoever had the SV before you tried that, screwed it up, and returned it.  Glad you figure it out.  I’m surprised that uploading a “stock” firmware doesn’t reset defaults though.  Maybe it is supposed to?"

Any problems with say having the stock SV viewer AND the Tower app connected to the drone at the same time and flying a mission?

There is a bit a delay in the video when switching from Tower to the SV App and if you are in the SV App you won’t get Tower Audio messages. One thread at a time.

228,Another Bricked Transmitter,1,This is now the third person (including myself) whose transmitter was bricked after a firmware update. * Can someone from the dev group PLEASE investigate?  SkyViper has absolutely no support team to be found. You guys are the only ones that can be communicated with.,"Hi Scott, Would it be possible to have you send us your bricked TX so we can look at it, please? We can exchange it for another TX unit that we will double check here before sending it out. Also, I’d like to point out that our Support Team is VERY much active and can ALWAYS be found and is doing the best to kick-ass on the replys. I, myself, even jump in daily to help get the number of tickets down. We are a Toy Company that does many other items than just the Sky Viper, and coming through the Holidays, we get slammed no matter how many people we have on the phones, chats, or email. We’ve only seen one ticket come through customer support with this issue before, and while we’ve asked for the TX to be sent to us for a replacement, we haven’t received it yet. Thank you, Matt"

SkyViper has absolutely no support team to be found. You guys are the only ones that can be communicated with.,"Hi Scott, I’m the author of the transmitter firmware, so if there is a software bug in it (which seems likely given your description) then it will be my bug. As Matt said, you can return it and we can look at it, or if you prefer to work on debugging it yourself then I can go through it with you. First step would be to open it up and attach a debug serial cable (you’ll need to solder on some wires for that) so you can look at the startup messages. Let me know if you want to go that route and I can provide details on how to start the debugging. If a serial link doesn’t help then you’d need a stlinkv2 programmer to be able to read and write code on the STM8. The design of the software is meant to prevent bricking from being possible, but there is always the possibility of a bug. Cheers, Tridge"

Instead I just got “be patient we’ll answer in the order your request came in” that was 2 weeks ago. Anyways, I’m still waiting on a replacement from my retailer or i would have already taken it apart or would certainly ship it to you. It looks like they may not require me to ship back the broken one, so if not, I’ll ship it to you. I definitely want to help you guys diagnose it. I had assumed that maybe it was something I did until others said the same thing. Anyways, i know you guys are doing your best. As both an engineer and a business major I know predicting demand can be challenging, but skyrocket is WAY behind on supporting their products from their main page. Phone line doesn’t work and emails go unanswered (barring the message I mentioned before).  And that isn’t just a Christmas problem, they’ve been unable to keep replacement parts in stock for years, I never could buy replacement props for my m200.  But I’m holding out hope because I like this product. As soon as I find out from Academy if I have to ship the broken one back I’ll let you know.  Until then I certainly won’t be opening the transmitter and soldering. "

229,I can't get my unit up!,1,"My Skyviper can’t get it up. After having flown the unit successfully for a few weeks including fully automated Mission Planner missions, I had some problems that required taking it back as close to original as I could, including a factory reset. Since then I have recalibrated using the web app via the Sonix.  I have also recalibrated using the Mission Planner routines. In the state that it is currently in, it will not lift more than a few inches from the ground.  It will bounce around a few inches up until it gets hung up on some grass and flips over.  I am not able to control the direction of drift because any input from the controller causes a pitch or roll motion followed by ground contact.  What should I do? The problem that I mentioned in the first paragraph was a failed motor which was replaced with a generic (aren’t they all) motor from Hobbyking.  After that I got a few short flights that reached 20 - 30 ft altitude but had poor altittude and position hold problems so I had it do an auto-tune which improved handling.  I then proceeded to do some manual parameter tuning to get back to where I had been happy with the performance.  Nothing radical, just adjusting geofence radius and return altitude and things like that. I have been trying to get it back to normal, including re-soldering the motor replacement splice, and several bouts of reset and re-calibrate with no improvement.  I have no logs, for all the good that would do me, because the sd card was ejected without my notice during one of the crashes.  I have replaced the card with a 16GB card from PNY witch has been unable to store any of the data or video even though the File System Access does report the presence of a card but with no files.  I have been unable to format the card with the app or with Windows10.  Must be a card problem. It is only a short walk to my wit’s end so tomorrow I will just play with the dogs and try to relax.","Have you tried flying it in ‘indoor mode’? This could rule out a couple of things. Also, these quads can have their altitude limited in the software. What is the altitude that the quad is sensing? If it was erroneously reading say 150ft while limited to 130ft it could cause problems. Also, do you confirm that the motors spin strongly as I suggested in the other thread when doing the motor testing? I would suppose this is okay since you say you’ve flown higher than a couple inches after the motor swap. Would you mind sharing your parameters? Maybe someone can spot something off."

I did try a takeoff in indoor mode with the same result.  I tried several times.

I then gave it full throttle and the prop rate increases equally but not greatly as if trying to takeoff.

229,I can't get my unit up!,5,"My Skyviper can’t get it up. After having flown the unit successfully for a few weeks including fully automated Mission Planner missions, I had some problems that required taking it back as close to original as I could, including a factory reset. Since then I have recalibrated using the web app via the Sonix.  I have also recalibrated using the Mission Planner routines. In the state that it is currently in, it will not lift more than a few inches from the ground.  It will bounce around a few inches up until it gets hung up on some grass and flips over.  I am not able to control the direction of drift because any input from the controller causes a pitch or roll motion followed by ground contact.  What should I do? The problem that I mentioned in the first paragraph was a failed motor which was replaced with a generic (aren’t they all) motor from Hobbyking.  After that I got a few short flights that reached 20 - 30 ft altitude but had poor altittude and position hold problems so I had it do an auto-tune which improved handling.  I then proceeded to do some manual parameter tuning to get back to where I had been happy with the performance.  Nothing radical, just adjusting geofence radius and return altitude and things like that. I have been trying to get it back to normal, including re-soldering the motor replacement splice, and several bouts of reset and re-calibrate with no improvement.  I have no logs, for all the good that would do me, because the sd card was ejected without my notice during one of the crashes.  I have replaced the card with a 16GB card from PNY witch has been unable to store any of the data or video even though the File System Access does report the presence of a card but with no files.  I have been unable to format the card with the app or with Windows10.  Must be a card problem. It is only a short walk to my wit’s end so tomorrow I will just play with the dogs and try to relax.",Its UP!  I finally got around to running the 100 percent power motor test.  It was very clear that one of the motors did not match the others in power.  It was the one that I had just replaced.  I had bought a set of 4 so I still had one with the right rotation/  I did a quick replacement and a quick cllibration and took it out to try.  It is very windy so I kept it  below 20 feet.  POS_HOLD and ALT_HOLD were a little uncertain but it responded well to stick commands so I will wai for a better day to get it trimmed up. Lesson learned.  These little motors can go half bad.  I had not expected that.  I thought these brushed motors worked or not.  The first replacement had provided two or three flights before it went half bad.  The 100 percent power test is a quick and easy way to find out.  Thanks for all of your help.

If you’re a bit better equipped throw it on a power supply with an oscilloscope."

Well maybe a DVM and a soldering iron.  I do have a fairly well equipped machine shop but thats from another day.  As to further testing on that motor.  Not very likely.  I consider anything that costs less than 3 dollars to be unrepairable.  Just for curiosity, I disassembled the first motor, or I should say demolished, the first bad motor.  I am convinced that it is next to impossible to open one of these things and put it back together reliably.  These things are an amazing piece of design and manufacturing but they are disposable. They are also in a sense, very crude.  The commutator is nothing more than the bare ends of the armature winding glued to a plastic core.  The brushes are just very thin metal strips imbeded in the plastic structure of the end cap and held in contact with the “commutator” by the tension of their own flex.  They last a few hours and are not able to take any stresses, particularly high current caused by a hard stall. It is hard to imagine a better example of meeting the design parameters for the intended application.  Easily repairable is not one of those parameters.  This one is 8.5mm diameter.  I think they are made smaller than 6mm diameter. I would really like to see the equipment that creates that coreless armature.  The Chinese must have developed a copper based silkworm for the job."
230,Stream from multiple skyvipers to vlc,1,"Hi, i read that is posible to stream to vlc. Do you guys know which address command to put in vlc to received video stream from multiple skyvipers ?","You’ll need to invoke multiple copies of VLC, then File->Open Network Stream Assuming you’re on windows you can also invoke it directly with “vlc.exe rtsp://ip:554/media/stream2” If you want multiple streams in the same display, the easiest route is probably RSTP->DirectShow->OBS Studio *. Keep in mind there are only 3 non-overlapping wifi channels available - 1, 6, and 11. According to FCC docs the controller can operate on channel -1 at 2409mhz, but that still overlaps channel 1: *  The drone only transmits 185mW, so the noise floor rises extremely fast due to the inverse square law being a bitch. *  * "

I have no idea why, because the spectrums should be compatible, but anyways, you need to enable airplane mode (which turns off cell and Bluetooth) then reenable only your wifi.

The STM8 MCU starts doing very strange things at low voltages. If that isn’t it then the second most likely cause is a stuck button on the transmitter. Try wiggling all the buttons to make sure one isn’t stuck. If those two suggestions don’t fix it and it doesn’t blink at all or play its startup tune then there must be a hardware fault in the transmitter, sorry. Cheers, Tridge"

After the firmware upgrade of TX, the app must have shown you the message of power cycling your TX. In that step, how much time did you wait from the point you turned off the TX and turned back on?   After the process of 11 beeps (when TX was actually installing new firmware), did the TX get stuck with a constant red light on or did it show the Green light of GPS? Did you have to do any force shutdown?   How was the signal strength (both data and cellular) of your phone when the TX firmware update happened ? also, how was the GPS reception at that location?

In an ideal case where the update gets installed successfully, the TX would just reboot normally with a green GPS light and connection to the drone.

234,GPS performance improvement,1,"I’ve had some trouble with fairly slow GPS fix and sometimes the reported position drifts 50 meters or more after the fix is good enough to turn on the green LED.  Only very rarely would the ground station report a 3D+DGPS fix.  I had similar problems with my home built quad before I moved the GPS to a short mast to get it away from the other electronics.  This post details a couple of things I have done and learned so far in an effort to improve GPS performance on the Sky Viper. A:  If you fly topless by removing the top cover to save 3 grams of weight, don’t be tempted protect the GPS module from the elements by covering it with a piece of tape.  Surprisingly, tape on the antenna seems to reduce performance.  I believe that this is because the ceramic antenna can be detuned a bit by the additional dielectric on the antenna surface. B.  I added a layer of shield/RF absorbing tape between the GPS and the flight controller board.  I purchased a sheet of 3M AB6005S EMI absorbing tape from Digi-key and cut a piece to fit the plastic layer between the flight controller and GPS.  I cut a slot for the GPS cable and carefully applied it to the plastic on the flight controller side.  The EMI absorber tape includes an insulator layer, but to be safe, I added extra kapton tape at points where the board might not be separated from the EMI tape by the pre-existing foam block.  The EMI tape adds less than half a gram of weight.  There is one potential problem with this modification.  The tape blocks the holes in the plastic and will reduce air flow. Hopefully the board won’t overheat.  So far, so good, but it is winter here.  I still need to check the board temperature after flying indoors.  *  C.  While I had everything disassembled, I twisted the motor wires to reduce RF noise and magnetic interference.  Be careful to route the motor wires in the narrow side channel to keep the antennas separated from the motor wires as much as possible when you reassemble the arms.  You will also want to perform both compass and motor calibration via the web page after reassembly since the positions of the wires have changed and the magnetic field induced by motor current will be affected. I’ve only flown twice since making these modifications, but both times, I got a green light in less than a minute, much faster than most of my previous flights.  In addition the ground station reported 3D+DGPS 1-3 minutes into both flights and the GPS drift was minimal.

I even get a fast fix inside some areas of the house. Unfortunately, it does seem to overheat when flying indoors.  There must be some protection built in because after flying for about 3 minutes, power is reduced and it ends up on the floor until it cools off.  I haven’t checked the logs yet, but I’m sure it just overheated.  I’ll try removing the tape from the air holes and see if there is still enough shield to help the GPS.  Or perhaps just the twisted motor wires will help."

M4 started out around half scale, similar to the other outputs.  It stayed that way for a couple of minutes, then gradually increased while the other outputs stayed about the same until it reached maximum.  This is when the drone lost power.  It looks like the driver which overheated just reduced it’s actual output until the controller could no longer compensate by increasing the commanded output power. In any case, I am sure it was a case of overheating.  I removed the EMI absorbing tape from the inside of the frame shell.  With the shell holes uncovered again, flying indoors for 15 minutes straight showed no sign of the overheating problem. Of course, the poor GPS performance also returned.  Obtaining a GPS fix took longer on the next flight outside and worse, after the controller indicated a good fix and hovering in loiter for a minute, I had to switch to altitude hold mode because the drone kept taking off in one direction or another.  The ground station display showed the reported location rapidly drifting well over a hundred feet from the actual location.  Apparently just twisting the motor wires does not help GPS performance.

This time I would place it above the frame shell.  I thought I might replace the GPS board with a layer of cardboard and EMI absorbing tape then mount the GPS above that, leaving the frame shell holes open for ventilation.  But this would be quite a small shield unless I made the cardboard square larger than the GPS board.  Then I thought, perhaps the EMI absorbing material didn’t need to be all one piece.  So my plan was a small square of it under the GPS board and more on the top of the frame shell just outside the vent holes. Attaching some tape directly to the top of the frame shell seemed easier to than figuring out how to place a layer under the GPS board, so I did it first.  Here is a photo showing the EMI tape after being cut to the correct shape and applied to the frame shell.  I cut out the EMI tape using a paper template I made with a square hole in the center about the size of the GPS board and shaped to fit the frame shell.  This makes a funny shaped but continuous “ring” of EMI absorber which avoids covering the holes in the shell.   At this point I thought I might as well test to see if this part of my plan had any effect.  I tested acquisition speed after powerup over a dozen times with the pictured simple configuration of EMI tape, both inside my house and outside in various locations.  I have also flown a few missions with the EMI tape applied in this configuration.  Surprisingly, GPS performance seems even better than previous experiment with the tape on the inside of the frame shell.  I’m getting the green light on the controller very quickly, and the HDOP, GPS status and number of satellites all converge to favorable numbers in only a minute or two.  I’m also not seeing any more of the wandering location issues after launch and I seem to be able to leave the SV in loiter mode for long periods of time without it wandering off as tries to compensate for the large GPS position errors.  I may never bother to add the square of cardboard and EMI tape under the GPS board as I had planned.  I’m honestly not sure why this is working so well.  Perhaps most of the noise was coming from the video module and the ground plane inside the controller board was already blocking some of the RF noise near the center of the GPS module.  Or perhaps the ring of shielding tape simply acts to increase the efective size of the ground-plane resulting in a stronger signal.  In any case, I am much happier with the way it flys in  loiter and auto modes! Again, if anyone else tries this, please let us all know how it works for you."

Sending it up just above our roof line, the sat count went to a solid 19 for a couple of minutes, with little discernible drift in position. That said, there was only a 1 knot wind. 33 degrees F.  During this flight, UAV Forecast was predicting 18 sats with a Kp of 1.

235,Mission Interrupted by RTL,1,"I have my Skyviper tuned pretty well and have been able to create and load a couple of missions with Mission Planner.  My flying area is about 10 acres and I have been experimenting with flight plans that run close to the edges of the field. I expected and get RTL interruptions due to loss of TX.  These do not always happen at the same spot in the flight but are always at a distance of over 200 ft.  As the drone heads for home in RTL mode, I can switch it back to Auto mode and it will go back to where it lost TX and continue the mission. Some times it takes two or more trips back to the flight path before it continues but then it completes the mission or maybe fails a few more times but unless the battery drops too low, I can get it to complete the mission.  Today I flew it in higher winds than usual and it was confidence inspiring.  This controller and the software is a great match up. I forgot to ask my question.  I think there is a way to ignore los of TX while in AUTO mode so that the mission will complete but I cant find it.  The autopilot has all the data it needs. It does not the TX data at that point, does it?",Set FS_THR_ENABLE to “Enabled Continue with Mission in Auto Mode” (2)
236,Increasing the range of the Skyviper V2450 GPS?,0,"I have seen some discussion here about increasing its range by making the GeoFence value higher and also turning off the Radio Range Safety feature.  I have tried making the Geo Fence Limit higher in the flight calibrations but it resets itself to the default 100 (m?).  I am not looking for anything crazy distance wise considering the limited battery, but I would like to try and stretch my mission out to about double the size of the current Geo Fence.  Any specific suggestions on how to do it safely?",
237,"Mobile device has to be in ""airplane mode""?",0,"So I’ve noticed that the SV app tells you that “if you have issues connecting make sure your device is in airplane mode” And sure enough, while i can see the “strong” wifi signal from the SV, after connecting to it I cannot even get to the web interface unless i turn off all other radios.  What is the reason the signal is so interrupted? My phone is able to operate on wifi and GSM with no issues, and the wigi strength indicator, at least up close, appears to be pretty strong from the SV.  So what’s the deal here?  This is mostly for my curiosity. It’d be nice to be able to get real-time maps from my 4G while working with the SV.  Is this an issue with any RC that connects in this way?",

I completed the 6 axis calibration, and perhaps my SV now does a better job of reaching and holding a position after a quick maneuver. That said, only 8 sats were locked when I did the recent tests, so overall I think the SV did great! However during motor calibration, with my finger holding the SV down, it was easy to feel different levels of vibration from each of the prop/gear/motor combinations (“a motor”). My SV has bad jello in the video. The left front “motor” vibrated much more than the other three, and the right rear was not great either. Not sure there is any easy way to remove those vibration sources (other than to replace one or more components), but I’m open to tips. Some of the snapshots were unusable. If SkyRocket wants to send replacement motor components, that would be nice. And by now maybe someone has developed/discovered a way to balance the SV props. However, could some of the vibration be from loose fit of the gear assembly? Overall from my experience, users need to be very patient during transitions from system state to system state. Lots of lag in some transitions, less lag in others. Perhaps some of the lag is due to my iPhone 5S. I remain excited by the SkyViper as a tool for STEM courses and other purposes.

253,What parameter dictates failsafe behavior when contact with TX is lost?,1,"Hi there, I’m a brand-new V2450GPS owner (and a brand-new drone owner to boot), and I’m already very much in love. And let me just say, as someone who loves tweaking and adjusting things to max out performance, it’s very heartening to see Skyrocket starting to establish itself as an Android-esque competitor to the Apple-esque Parrots and DJIs of the drone world! I had a couple of quick questions that I didn’t find an obvious answer to when searching the help materials: First, what parameter determines when the V2450 will RTL after losing contact with the TX?  I found the FS_GCS_ENABLE toggle, but that specifies it isn’t used unless RC_Override is engaged, and I can’t find any info on that parameter.  Does it just go by the FENCE parameter? At 100m, I’d assume the FENCE parameter issues an RTL command well before the drone loses contact with the TX. Secondly, what is considered NORMAL behavior to see during both LOITER mode and RTL mode?  The drone appears to wander and correct over an area of 4-5 meters while loitering, and when performing an RTL it usually ends up about 2-3 meters away from the point where I launched it.  I’ve only flown this copter about 6 times thus far, and I’ve always had 16-18 satellites connected before launching, so I’m sure the GPS signal is about as good as it gets. Thanks for any insights, and if there’s somewhere in the help materials that would have answered these questions, please feel free to point me there instead.","I think what you are looking for with regard to TX FS is FS_THR_ENABLE and FS_THR_VALUE. With regard to GPS accuracy, the number of satellites isn’t the only factor.  2-3 meters is fairly normal.  You will often see greater error and wander for the first few minutes after it thinks the GPS is adequate.  Other factors such as high vibration and bad compass calibration can, of course also cause trouble.  I’ve noticed my SV seems to have more GPS trouble than my larger home-build which has the GPS mounted nice and high above the other electronics. –Brad"

With respect to your questions: Parameter that controls what happens when TX is lost   is FS_THR_ENABLE (set by default to RTL). This is because when TX connection is lost throttle goes below  FS_THR_VALUE (set at 975 by default) and that triggers FS_THR_ENABLE. RC_OVERRIDE is not a copter parameter but a mavlink command/parameter  involved with GCS so you can ignore if not using GCS. If you are then FS_GCS_ENABLE controls what to do if GCS connection is lost. As far as “normal” behavior of loiter and RTL, of course it depends but I’d say 4-5 meter loiter precision is sub-par. Does your copter have a tendency to circle when it wanders within that range? If so could be compass issue and re-calibration might fix that. Also remember that it’s not only satellite count, but really  (although that’s related) speed, position and height computed accuracy that matters. So you could technically have some situation where accuracy is worse with say 10 satellites that with 8, That said 16-18 sats should give you good accuracy.

The compass seemed okay,  I did do the simple accelerometer calibration and the magnetometer calibration, I’m less than confident about the latter however (I always struggle to correctly do the crazy figure 8’s to calibrate my phone’s compass), I might as well re-try that one if I still see it wandering so much. Before that though, it sounds like maybe I just need to try it a few more times (maybe in a few different locations) due to some additional variables I hadn’t considered. Very helpful re: the FS_THR_ENABLE flag, thanks.  I started researching it a bit, but that lead to other questions like “What the hell is PWM and how the $%@* can you measure it in microseconds?”  I am assuming whatever PWM is, it would drop towards 975 as the drone loses signal from the TX, and a PWM value < 975 = “the drone is too far away, stupid” and RTL This would also, of course, mean there is absolutely no reason for me to mess with this setting at ALL, right? I can’t imagine “Sweet I’ve flown this thing like 7 times, time to start disabling safety features and seeing how far away I can fly this thing!” is an ideal scenario.  I freaked out a little bit the first time I hit the RTL button and the drone unexpectedly rose from 6’ to 15’ before it came back to me, to give an indication of my experience level here. I guess on that note, as a beginner drone pilot/enthusiastic tinkerer, is there anything I really need to be doing in the web server options?  I’ve set up throw mode as described in the Skyrocket main article here, and that worked great. I tried setting up “Flip” as an action, as well as a toggle for “Simple” mode (I’d like to just learn to correctly fly a drone from the start, but Simple mode sounded great for letting my wife try it out) using the same mode+button setup as you use for Throw mode, but neither seems to do anything so I’m sure I’ve set something up incorrectly or this drone simply can’t execute those commands.  Is my time at this stage better sent just getting outside and flying the damn thing?"

But also use google or your favorite search engine and continue your research using the wealth of information already available on the Internet!  You will quickly find answers to your questions and on the way, acquire knowledge which includes some traditional RC history, technology, the meaning of terms like PWM, and the capabilities of the wonderful general purpose open-source Ardupilot firmware the SV is based on. In the mean time, I will try to clarify one last thing.  The FS_THR_VALUE setting and PWM is not a measure of distance in any way.  Rather, it is a threshold value for the received representation of the position of the throttle, below which, the flight controller will assume the receiver isn’t receiving anything from the transmitter at all.  In particular, the receiver communicates loss of signal to the flight controller as a specific throttle position which is lower than any throttle value which the transmitter will actually send.  FS_THR_VALUE is configurable to allow for different transmitters and receivers which may be configured for different ranges of values.  The reason RC receivers usually work this way is because traditional RC hobbyists didn’t want their model airplanes flying on until they ran out of fuel in case they flew out of range of the transmitter.  Better to cut the throttle and crash-land as close to the flying range as possible.  Drones are smarter than traditional RC airplanes so they use this traditional receiver behavior in different ways. You can and probably should go read all about how and why the positions of the sticks are often represented by PWM, but for now, just know that, as you guessed, you shouldn’t change FS_THR_VALUE.  This advice also applies to most of the other parameters you see on the web page, especially those which you don’t yet fully understand.  "

Again, your response is super appreciated, as I didn’t even understand the relationship between throttle position and PWM well enough to understand what I needed to Google. In my head, I was thinking “not touching the throttle stick” = PWM of “0”, whereas not touching the stick is actually putting the PWM at its middle value. Makes sense! The V2450 uses the “Low throttle” failsafe method then, not the newer “No signal” method? Also, I have tried Googling this again but I’m still coming up short - is it possible to set up the FLIP command, and enable SIMPLE mode on the V2450?  I followed the instructions for setting up THROW mode and it worked perfectly, but I can’t get these other two to work. I bound SIMPLE to “ACTION6” and I bound FLIP to “ACTION4”. I had figured this would mean I could just trigger ACTION4 while in a hover and the drone would do a flip, and I could use ACTION6 to toggle SIMPLE mode on and off, but neither function seems to work.  (These aren’t vital things for me to accomplish, if I’m asking for trouble I can just let them go. I just thought it’d be fun to have those features available for my wife, she wants to try the drone out with me but she’s a lot less interested in really learning how to fly one. I picked SIMPLE mode over SUPER_SIMPLE because she’d be flying it maybe 5 feet away from her at most)"

That data is useless without the correct time though. It does cache the time, and if you don’t get an external source of time then it assumes that two minutes have gone past since the last time the cache was updated (rough battery change and new flight time).

I ended up removing the original battery clip and reassembling with color coded plastic “washers” made from large zip ties.  Just drill holes the correct distance apart in the zip ties and cut to desired length.  Note that the front and back holes are not the same spacing.  Then use the more traditional rubber bands and/or Velcro to hold the battery in place.  I put a small piece of Velcro under the battery to prevent it from sliding while the rubber bands hold it firmly in place.

263,SkyViper glider tow,0,"* The SkyViper is a real hit with the kids at our flying field. On Sunday afternoon we tried something new, using a SkyViper to tow launch a tiny balsa glider. Toby and Cassandra led the project by building their balsa gliders and attaching them to the SkyViper. The glider was attached to the SkyViper using a couple of tea-bag strings, earning the SkyViper the nickname “tea-bag copter”. A small piece of tape was used to hold it to the nose of the plane. After climbing to a good height a bit of forward speed would pull off the tape and the glider released nicely. The string was looped around the battery lead of the SkyViper. It worked rather well, so we can now add glider tow aircraft to the list of abilities of the SkyViper.   The first flight ended with the tea-bag string caught around a SkyViper propeller, bring it down fast (with no damage). After that we added a small pebble to the string to weight it, and the second flight went perfectly.         ",

While there can be variation in items within a manufacturing batch, I suspect that having balanced props remains the most effective way to reduce vibration on this product. To test that assumption, I swapped the left-front prop (the noisiest by far during my Motor Cal test) with the right-rear prop. Most of the vibration shifted to the right-rear. You might want to swap out props from the spare set to see if your video quality improves. There’s not much to isolate the camera from the drone body, so it’s possible that a physical hack with softer foam could reduce vibration transfer to the camera. Rather than speculate further, I’ll leave it up to a SkyRocket rep to respond."

Using a Win10 laptop, I waited to get a connection to the SkyViper network, opened Edge, entered 192.168.99.1, selected the Calibration page, then the MotorCal tab. I placed the SkyViper on a thin rubber mat and held it down with a finger while running either of the tests. By swapping a prop and running a test, I could roughly rank the level of vibration across a row of props, then pick the one that seemed to be the best. (This process would produce faster, better results if there was also a test only for each motor (rather than all four in sequence).) If your results are not good enough, and you don’t mind different prop colors in non-stock positions, you can swap a green “A” prop for a black “A” prop. (Note the A or B symbol on the underside. There is also a number that may represent a manufacturing batch.) Overall, my results were good enough for me, and noticeably better than out-of-the-box. Other things that might contribute to “jello” in video clips: loose fit of metal motor shaft in plastic column; variation in closeness of plastic gear mesh; tight clamping of the video camera in the SV body; you did not fasten the prop screw securely; you or a flying insect harmed the prop in a previous flight."

273,Strange issue with logging and getting parameters,0,"I have 3 skyvipers who all have the same issue. This issue  happened almost  right away on one, and after 2-3 flights on the others. In short when connected via the web server I started seeing an arming failure “bad logging” on mission planner when connected, shortly after uploading a (first) mission. Pretty sure of that part (after uploading mission)  but not 100%certain. Since then after  boot neither baro, imu, etc … data shows up in “System Status”, nor do parameters show up in “Flight Parameters”, on web page. On any of the three. Now here’s the “interesting part” (or is it ) All I need to do to have the above show up is connect with a GCS. MP grabs the parameters and a web page refresh shows everything correctly. After disabling “Logging when available” arming check (change default mask 32767 to 31742)  I can fly just fine. Missions, flips, throws, mavproxy, qgc, mp, auto, guided etc … all work …did lots of flying  on all three. Just to be sure I downgraded all firmwares to everything to versions I got from the store (date 8/26 or so) on the last one.  (Had them all on 10/11). Same problem, even after resetting to factory defaults. How strange is that? Well, one slight difference, but I don’t know that would be repeatable (only saw it twice). On 10/11 firmwares, (when booting without first connecting to GCS) netcat to dev console showed messages that 18 params were downloaded, waiting for count of 832. After downgrading,  see below. Here’s a screen shot of dev console before GCS connect, on “stock” firmware. Is this strange or what? ",

As you mentioned the other day the system must be running out of memory, but I haven’t been able to figure out where so that it could  be made to return with an error (replace unused result var with, say,  a set_upload_message())  and without a connection break.

During the latest, manually-guided flight, the message appeared and remained on display, blocking much of the video view, which doesn’t help when trying to guide to a landing. I waited for a few moments and GPS Mode was restored, however the message remained. Apparently the message is not removable, even temporarily. It seemed odd to me that I had no trouble continuing to guide the drone in flight, and it responded appropriately to the Return button.

The app uses a WiFi link, whereas the TX uses quite a different protocol, so what you describe is consistent with the WiFi link dropping out for some reason. Maybe try re-connecting the WiFi if it happens again? Cheers, Tridge"

With a fully charged battery in the drone, new AA batteries in the controller, and my laptop with Mission Planner connected along with my iPhone running the SkyViper app, I encountered several problems: a) map tiles slow to load and not appearing to completely load; b) no video feed in the SkyViper app; c) after all connections were made, and the drone battery reported as 87%, I launched and the battery dropped to 25% then down to 12% at landing. Multimeter reading of the battery voltage is 3.94. So…  a few minutes later I went indoors and connected the drone to charge for maybe 15 minutes, then (still indoors at a bench) I powered up the drone, the controller (“TX” in the SkyViper messages) and the SkyViper app. The app stated the battery was at 75%. No GPS Mode initially because I am indoors. Apparently the lack of any video from the camera is a hint that GPS Mode has not been achieved, because after a few minutes sat lock was achieved and video was displayed. Wondering if the drone battery is defective or has been compromised during the 12-15 flights to-date. No date for replacement batteries yet from SkyViper. My overall impression is that one needs to be very slow in interacting with the various components of the system, otherwise it’s not clear (at least to me through the controller or app UIs) what to do next, and in what sequence. It’s a new product, so some issues are not surprising. Looking forward to seeing it evolve."

That definitely needs to be made smarter. The fix would need to be in the app, which I don’t work on, as the app does the mapping from voltage to battery percentage. I suspect it isn’t properly taking into account the throttle on the motors. I’ve pointed out this thread to some of the app developers."
